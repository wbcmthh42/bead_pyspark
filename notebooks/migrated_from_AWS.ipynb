      "4    I don’t understand why IMDA would allow MediaCorp to import 南洋女儿情 [PRC show set in Singapore]. Why is PRC making shows set in Singapore, and it’s not the only one. Awhile back, PRC made their own Little Nyonya reboot. \\n\\nI have a sneaking suspicion that this is the early stages of PRC’s attempt to neo-colonialise Singapore. Keep making shows set in historical Singapore infused with modern day PRC shenanigans, once a critical mass is achieved, use the shows as “evidence” that we’re not so different. \\n\\nThe show is supposedly about Samsui women in Singapore but other than plot mentions, it doesn’t feel like Singapore. They don’t even speak like Singaporean. You may argue that this was set in early days, so the early immigrants still speak like in their hometown. Even then, they should sound Southern Chinese. They’re of course speaking the standard PRC Mandarin that’s more Northern. \\n\\nYou may argue, even in our own shows they speak in Mandarin, when historically they should speak in dialect. But it’s not just the language they speak, it’s how they speak. There is no attempt to make it realistic at all. In fact, I argue they want to portray the Samsui women as speaking like modern PRC women. See! We the same!!\\n\\nAlso, the Samsui women in this alternate reality are basically 姑娘s man   \n",
