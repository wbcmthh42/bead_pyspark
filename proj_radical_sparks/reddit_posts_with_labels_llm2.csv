No right or wrong answer. Just which you will regret less when you are old.

There are both passion majors and money majors that regret their decision. Passion majors hate struggling financially. Money majors hate their life is a cog in a machine. 

But I'd say being a cog is better than struggling financially. If you had to cry, I'd rather cry in a BMW than crying at the void deck... Nothing wrong with void decks. Money means you got alot of flexibility to throw letter/escape/spend and not feel the pressure.

Yeah i read thru all your posts; kinda briefly glanced it thru and got the gist of it, and yea i agree and sympathise with your anger as as well as bitterness, but lets break it down for a moment.   
  
What can you do now moving forward? Everything you mentioned lacks evidence; SPF hence wont take action accordingly. Even if there is evidence to back it, would honestly all amount to a load of nothing; SPF cannot do much about it, neither can anyone else. If you report it to their schs (and assuming the buy the story), they will instead try to gaslight you and make u feel bad or smth, ""do u really want to destroy another persons future blablabla"" and yeah you get the idea. 

Realistically, what you can do, is attempt to become better and strive to improve on yourself. Personally imo it feels like you are also angry at yourself, being unable to do anything despite all these. Talk it out. See a therapist or smth. (But keep in mind therapists do no miracles, they can only help you IF you WANT to move on). No money to see a therapist? Try talking it out (like aloud) in front of a mirror or smth. It works for some people, idk if it will work for you, but no harm trying. Try searching up Dr K from healthygamergg; look thru his videos and try to get a better understanding of yourself, who knows, it might actually lead to you being able to move on, after becoming more at peace with both yourself and the world around you.   
  
And also, dont try to compete against them. End of the day, alot of their achievements whatever amounts to almost nothing in the grand scheme of things, since its only still at like a pre-uni level kinda stage. There are people ik who have royally screwed up everything in their life, only to have a massive glow up/ jump in grades/ became the best versions of their selves in university, and some, even beyond that. Its just a longer learning curve/ incubation period; thats all. But if you still choose to remain mad and not even attempt to remove yourself from whatever predicament you face, then its what i would call a self-fufilling prophecy: you think you are stupid, hence you never strive to become better, which in turn leads to mediocre results, which only feeds the cycle.

take notes, learn words, read the book “Fluent Forever” by Gabriel Wyner. Work smart not hard. The book offers some EXTREMELY smart hacks on language learning and I paid a shitton for Goethe Institut in Singapore for german and i never got to know any of these memory hacks for words. look on reddit for language learning hacks as well. 

It truly is possible to use such hacks to make language learning a little easier (and of course you need to put in some work too and figure out and take note of the top most common words in your language). 

have you considered going for korean classes so you can strengthen your foundation? For german, in germany there are like 2-week or 4-week crash course programs where you really smash through basics and intermediate korean, for 5 days a week, something like that. Your korean would DEFINITELY improve after that kind of crash course and you’d have an edge for sure! 

i really feel you. i had to learn german and i cried and cried so many times esp when extended family was mean and cruel to me about my german speaking. and i am not great at studying and focus so i really struggled. i’m pretty good now though, passable lah. 

but i wanna tell you that it’s possible to gain improvement in Korean and though it does take far longer to understand the slides etc., if you do take Korean classes at the same time and take notes on common sentences/words that come up, you’ll eventually find it easier. 

a Korean teacher can advise you better too, some Korean teachers are trained to help non-native speakers survive Korean university, your situation is not unique so they have experience in such cases. 

and once you have the language down a bit better, gaining new friendships and feeling more comfortable socially may be easier too. try going to meetups and meeting new folks, esp non-locals in Korea if you’re in Seoul. Seoul is super happening! 

Don’t isolate yourself even if you’re struggling, again, not good for mental health. Try to get out there, join meetup groups and just make some new friends. 

tbh, i think you may be underestimating the difficulty of taking As as a private candidate. 

you may struggle w mental health esp because you’re all alone trying to study daily, and tuition is advisable. I don’t know if this would be the best route for you. 

And, i don’t know what the loan situation is like in SG for tuition loans for PRs and also how you’ll manage to reside in SG for the 4 years of university.

Evidence of NTU throwing its top tier Nanyang Scholarship to 90 RP students without interview. It has been like this since more than 10 years ago. Personally, I don't think without interview is good. Because I personally know really weird (no EQ in BMT and cause lots of trouble in BMT) people getting this top tier Nanyang Scholarship, just because of 90 RP. At the bare minimal there should be some form of short interview, or at least short zoom interview.

>I was offered the Nanyang Scholarship to pursue a double degree in Business and Computing, while if I decide to go for the E-Scholars Programme instead, I would be taking up Computer Engineering. Scored 90RP in the A-Levels.

Advice don't do double degree for the sake of getting 2 degree certificates or just to diversify employment outlook. Whether it's worth taking double degrees, it really depends on a few factors, as explained in my comment in a post (link below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/t0ss5o/comment/hyc47ru/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/t0ss5o/comment/hyc47ru/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

As mentioned in above link, I have a friend who did NTU Business and Computing Double Degree ended up getting 2nd lower-class honours for both degrees. I have another friend take same double degree but in NUS, end up become software engineer, and he say he didn't even use any business degree knowledge, so is waste of his time (1 year later graduation too) studying the additional business degree in NUS.

In fact, its better to use the extra year of getting double degree to instead do a masters degree. Employers tend to give higher educational qualification higher starting salary. 2 Bachelor's degree is still at bachelor's level, and generally lose to 1 bachelor's degree + 1 master's degree (which i think that's what NUS e-scholars have right).

1bef9v1,kuta3xf,2024-03-14 17:56:40,JaylenChua,"First off, this is a very in-depth argument supported by both qualitative and quantitative analysis, which I think is pretty amazing. Ironically, this seems more PW-esque than most PW WRs.

I think you might want to send your concerns directly to the Permanent Secretary for Education, as they would be the main officer permanently in charge of MOE's functioning and policies. You could also direct your concerns to the Director-General of Education. This way, your message may be able to funnel through to Education Policy Division or Curriculum Planning Division from a more top-down way, as compared to going through MOE Customer Service.

As mentioned, yes, PW has been reformed to become Pass/Fail, but this serious feedback can help the Ministry as an important case study for future implementation of other policies and curricula - especially as MOE looks into alternative assessment frameworks.

Although, I will point out that no system will truly be meritocratic in Singapore, despite our best efforts - but alas, that's just my take. Also, this is not so much a matter of KPI, but more of a very real impact of ineffective policy and genuinely not knowing how to implement something to rectify it. 

As someone who has worked with the Unit in charge of PW for a brief period, this problem is definitely known to them, many of whom have experienced PW themselves as staff or even students awhile back, and the work being done to come up with new ways to rectify this is more challenging that you may expect - particularly as it involves national policy. It may benefit them if you have any ideas on how to impart 21st CC skills to students in a less consequential manner as PW.

I think PW will go down as a very painful and hated part of JC, even for people who may have benefitted from the system.

It seems that racial slurs are pretty much thrown around like regular nouns in everyday dialogue. Casual racism has become so widespread that it has essentially rooted itself into the youth culture of Singapore. What I am trying to say is that this problem is here to stay. Will teenagers grow up and do away with these remarks? I honestly have no clue. I am not sure if they think they are just saying words or if they actually harbour feelings of contempt for other races. If these backward tendencies are carried into the mainstream culture of Singapore, racial tensions could be further exacerbated (I think right now the different races tolerate each other). There are events written in our history books that detail the negative outcomes should these racial sentiments climax.

1b8zde1,kuci88v,2024-03-11 18:04:22,aucheukyan,"You are just picking the sections you like and ignoring the clearly stated precedence here in the same link: 

*Precedence at controlled crossing
7.  Wherever there is a pedestrian crossing at a road intersection or junction where traffic is controlled by a police officer or by light signals, every pedestrian, cyclist, mobility vehicle user and PMD rider who is about to enter or has entered such crossing shall be permitted free and uninterrupted passage over the crossing by all drivers of vehicles who are approaching the crossing notwithstanding that such drivers may have already received a signal to proceed either from the light signals or the police officer, as the case may be.*

The video is taken at a ‘controlled crossing’, the idiotic bike user is ‘about to enter’, the taxi is also ‘about to enter’ the crossing. No, the bike user isnt helping himself to be seen and thus almost gets swiped by the taxi. Still law is law, precedence still apply but in this case it isnt healthy for the bike user to enforce his right.

This is what the taxi driver or car is to do at a crossing also in the code: https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/RTA1961-R11?ProvIds=P1IV-

*77.  Pedestrians, pedal cyclists, riders of power-assisted bicycles or personal mobility devices, and drivers of mobility scooters or motorised wheelchairs have the right of way on pedestrian crossings.* 

There is no statement of whether it’s green or red light. Thus my point in my previous post.




*80.  At a pedestrian crossing controlled by light signals or by a policeman, give way to pedestrians, pedal cyclists, riders of power-assisted bicycles or personal mobility devices, and drivers of mobility scooters or motorised wheelchairs who are crossing when the signal to stop is given.*

*82.  Watch for the pedestrian, pedal cyclist, rider of a power-assisted bicycle or personal mobility device, or driver of a mobility scooter or motorised wheelchair who comes out suddenly from behind stationary vehicles and other obstructions. Be very careful near schools and bus stops. When turning at a road junction, give way to pedestrians, pedal cyclists, riders of power-assisted bicycles or personal mobility devices, and drivers of mobility scooters or motorised wheelchairs who are crossing.* 

It is clearly stated here….. regardless whether the idiotic bike user has suicidal intentions. Obviously the driver didnt check his right when he move off and the consequences of having ACEA GSR certified 3 ton machine is quite a bit lesser than a man on a bit of 6061 aluminium welded together.",It will still be car driver fault they say,Singapore,77.0,0.91,2024-03-11,no

Met a PRC guy in a HDB void deck in Pasir Ris who asked me for $10 as he had just lost his MRT card, was lost due to being new in Singapore and couldn't get home in Woodlands.  
I wasn't aware of the existence of scams then, but I was very confused on why he will ask for help in a void deck rather than people/officers at the MRT station so I offered to guide him there but he insisted I give him the money right now saying that it is only $10.

It was everything you'd expect from an MLM and so many boxes were ticked. I stayed to finish the entire thing anyway because frankly I didn't want to be rude about it and it was only about 10 minutes more before it was done

My second interviewer started off claiming that he was promoted to ""business owner"" and that his salary was somewhere between $10-15,000 monthly. Lol ok

I don't want to stereotype people or discriminate based on education level, but the ah beng style tone didn't really fit the position of a professional interview in my opinion, and I could tell that he was trying to get me to bite. He told me that I was accepted into the team and would need to have 3-4 weeks ""training period"" first. Needless to say I will absolutely ghost them, I wasn't born yesterday muthafck. I have another interview tomorrow and it's for a job in maritime, so nothing to fear as there was no mention of ""sales"" involved. Hope I nail that one instead

SINGAPORE: One does not need a Master of Economics to have felt acutely the recent impact of inflation. In the last few years, prices of everything from kaya toast to Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums have risen.

Core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport costs, averaged 2.3 per cent from 2020 to 2023, about double the 1.1 per cent seen in the pre-pandemic period of 2015 to 2019.

In January, core inflation came in at 3.1 per cent year-on-year, slightly lower compared with 3.3 per cent in December 2023 and a far cry from the 5.5 per cent peak seen in January 2023 and February 2023. Does this spell good news for the economy?

This current cycle of high inflation first started during the pandemic, with food and energy prices surging as a result of supply chain disruptions. These disruptions persisted after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Singapore was not spared from the impact, but several rounds of monetary policy tightening since October 2021 have helped to mitigate imported inflation and partially shielded us from the worst effects seen in other parts of the world.

If you haven’t heard, British rock legends are set to headline the upcoming Singapore Rockfest 2024, scheduled to take place on the little red dot in May.

The quintet will perform at Fort Canning Park on May 1.

Tickets, which are priced at $188, went on sale last month, with ticketing platform Sistic reaching out to Malaysian fans, inviting them to attend the concert across the Causeway.

""Attention all Malaysian rock fans!"" it wrote on its promotional materials, along with details and ticket prices of the gig.

This has triggered Malaysian netizens, with many expressing displeasure that, like Taylor Swift, the rock stars were giving their country a miss to perform in Singapore.

""Singapore again, I can't believe it,"" lamented one fan, while another wrote: ""Let them come to Malaysia to perform. Why is it always Singapore?""

With a storied career spanning over half a century and 22 albums, Deep Purple are one of the most successful rock bands of all time.

Best known for hits such as ‘Smoke On The Water’ (1972) and ‘Child In Time’ (1970), they last performed in Singapore at The Star Theatre in 2013.

1bbpvum,kuasynr,2024-03-11 08:31:22,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Some hospitals in Singapore offer plant-based menu options as part of sustainability drive  

SINGAPORE – Some hospitals in Singapore have started offering plant-based options on inpatient menus as part of their sustainability efforts, after evaluating them to be healthy and nutritionally balanced.

Alexandra Hospital (AH) and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH) have removed beef and mutton – considered the most carbon-intensive meat products globally – from their inpatient menus since August 2023, and replaced them with plant-based options made from soya protein.

KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) started offering plant-based options to patients in January 2023, while the National University Hospital (NUH) has been doing so since 2018.

According to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organisation, the livestock sector accounts for about 12 per cent of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions.

Said an NUH spokesperson: “A well-planned plant-based diet can offer numerous health benefits, and the incorporation of more plant-based foods into our diets can play a significant role in promoting environmental sustainability in the long run.”

These hospitals say their plant-based options are offered to patients at no additional cost, and that the meals have been evaluated by their dietitians to be healthy and nutritionally balanced.

Mr Kenneth Francisco, AH’s chef-cum-assistant director of group hospitality, said that during the process of creating a plant-based masala dish, he reduced the amount of salt by 20 per cent compared with the usual chicken or fish masala dish served to patients, after receiving feedback from the hospital’s in-house nutritionist.

This is due to the higher sodium levels found in most plant-based meat products.

KUALA LUMPUR: Singaporean businessman and prominent Malaysia property developer Akbar Khan is under investigation on allegations of money laundering and corruption by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).

MACC investigators temporarily detained Mr Akbar, who is the main shareholder of high-end developer BRDB Developments Sdn Bhd, for questioning last week after raiding his home and business premise in the capital Kuala Lumpur, senior sources from the agency and lawyers familiar with the situation told CNA.

Apart from freezing the business and personal accounts of the businessman, the MACC also ordered Mr Akbar to declare his assets and the financial holdings of his family, the sources added.

The 83-year-old Mr Akbar declined to comment on the MACC probe when contacted by CNA.

“As this is an ongoing matter, we refrain from commenting on specific details. Our primary focus remains on ensuring a fair investigation,” noted a spokesperson in Mr Akbar’s office.

MACC sources said the businessman is expected to be recalled by the agency for more questioning in the coming days together with other former close associates.

They played crucial roles in the repatriation of frozen shares valued at US$4 billion that were once listed in Singapore’s now-defunct over-the-counter market that traded mainly in Malaysian shares called Central Limit Order Book, or CLOB, and a controversial transaction involving the change of shareholding at conglomerate Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd (MPHB) in the late 1990s and 2000.

Mr Akbar is the latest in a growing cast of business personalities who have been ensnared in the MACC’s widening investigation on former finance minister Daim Zainuddin.

I do actually: more and more discussions on healthy (vs toxic) masculinity; male protagonists in movies/TV are far less likely to be the stereotypical macho male heroes of the past; increasing talk about how men can also be victims of sexual assault/harassment and domestic violence; conversations about male mental health and suicide; movements to increase paternity leave that some countries have implemented; greater awareness of single fathers and the support they need; AWARE advocating for gender-neutral NS; increasing focus on boys falling behind in schools; more men entering jobs previously associated with women, such as nursing and education; a general broadening of hobbies, interests and fashion that were traditionally associated with women but are now also considered acceptable for men.

Diversity hires also benefit many male minorities, as do other diversity initiatives and benefits. Overseas, movements like BLM primarily focus on men.

It was everything you'd expect from an MLM and so many boxes were ticked. I stayed to finish the entire thing anyway because frankly I didn't want to be rude about it and it was only about 10 minutes more before it was done

My second interviewer started off claiming that he was promoted to ""business owner"" and that his salary was somewhere between $10-15,000 monthly. Lol ok

I don't want to stereotype people or discriminate based on education level, but the ah beng style tone didn't really fit the position of a professional interview in my opinion, and I could tell that he was trying to get me to bite. He told me that I was accepted into the team and would need to have 3-4 weeks ""training period"" first. Needless to say I will absolutely ghost them, I wasn't born yesterday muthafck. I have another interview tomorrow and it's for a job in maritime, so nothing to fear as there was no mention of ""sales"" involved. Hope I nail that one instead

Thereafter, more MVNOs  joined the party. TPG upped its game and rebranded as SIMBA as gave 100GB at $10. Slowly, more mvno copied and followed.

1bdcvrv,kumlic5,2024-03-13 11:35:24,sandcrawler56,"I do agree partially with you. However to be fair is is a fact that its easier to learn things when you are younger compared to older. Learning new things as an adult usually means forcuing yourself to unlearn or rewire stuff that you already know / believe.   For example, when you learn a new language as an adult, you have to actively surpress the language you already know and the rules that come along with it. Its really hard. Children, on the other hand, can pick up languages, even multiple at once pretty easily if you start them young. Adults also have more things on their mind like a job to go to or kids to care for so they have less capacity to do things differently.

So I dont think its as simple as saying a child can learn it so older people should too becuase the circumstances are different.

I do think, however, that older people are definately responsible for their resistant mindset towards change and should do better there.

1bdecej,kunssuj,2024-03-13 19:20:00,UninspiredDreamer,"> A man has the same choices as a woman. He can continue working. He can work and do more housework. He can also stop working and be a house husband. The social expectations for him (as a man) are different than for a woman, and so some of these options will have different social push backs for a man. 

You are talking beyond the prevalent social norms but your initial talking points were the societal expectations of both men and women. Out of prevalent social norms anything is fair game.

> How is the man more disadvantaged here? Both gender groups are faced with social expectations and suffer negative push backs when they fall outside the expectation.  They are also given incentives to stay in their designated roles.

Within designated roles men are more disadvantaged, due to a lack of choice.

> Men get fully paid for their labor if the work. Women receive legal protections for their unpaid labor at home. 

If this is your fair take then frankly all this discussion on gender wage gap shouldn't be a thing.

In other words to summarize our current discourse right now, either:

You: men and women are either equally disadvantaged, and men should continue getting paid more and women should continue getting legal protection.

Me: Or men are more disadvantaged than women, due to a lack of choice yet for some reason the gender wage gap is a bigger social topic than the lack of legal protection for men. 

Regardless, it seems that women are not more disadvantaged than men. Yet the prevailing media seems to be focusing disproportionately on women.

> But, even if we want to take this into consideration, how exactly is this *leverage*? What it does is further perpetuate the idea of women as home makers. What leverage does a woman get from this, if she wants to pursue her career?

As settling for the social role of home maker, you disproportionately get protected by the law on the unfair valuation of domestic labour in terms of alimony and maintenance. Not to mention you get favoured in terms of child custody and care in the case of marital fallout. 

Women typically have more of a social and legal advantage to these decisions (after give birth, say want take a step back, bank on husband giving way, marital fallout can get the alimony and the kids). Husbands don't have the same recourse, it is an upward battle if things ever go sour, even the law doesn't protect them. Even things like paternity testing are not simply mandatory when in this day and age technology can simply provide for it. Instead society collective gaslight men that it is about ""trust"", all so that women can avoid accountability.

Are we gonna pretend there's no leverage or imbalance there?

> Then why are you comparing the examples of a man that earns 3k and a man that earns 10k, both living in a 3 room HDB flat? If you agree that between partners, their income is not the same, then all the more so that comparing different sets of partners, income patterns differ.

1bczcs6,kuj2rsa,2024-03-12 23:02:24,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Hiring outlook in Singapore weakens for 2nd quarter in a row: Survey  

SINGAPORE – Hiring sentiments in Singapore declined for a second consecutive quarter, driven by a sharp rise in employer pessimism in communication services, which include telecommunications and the media.

However, improved net employment outlooks in the finance and real estate sector, as well as the energy and utilities sector, helped cushion the drop, according to the latest results from recruitment firm ManpowerGroup’s quarterly employment outlook survey released on March 12.

Net employment outlook is a measure of hiring optimism, defined as the percentage of companies surveyed that intend to take on new staff, minus the percentage that intend to downsize.

Employers in the communication services sector reported a net employment outlook of negative 29 per cent, which means more firms polled from the sector intend to downsize than expand their headcount.

It is the only one of the nine sectors surveyed with a negative outlook in the latest results. The figure is down 72 percentage points from the previous quarter and 88 percentage points from the same time in 2023.

ManpowerGroup’s January poll of 525 employers in nine sectors on their hiring plans in the quarter ahead – the second quarter of 2024 – found net employment outlook to be 24 per cent overall. The survey also polled 41 other markets.

The 24 per cent is down 5 percentage points from the previous quarter’s net employment outlook, which was itself 7 percentage points lower compared with the quarter before that. The latest figure is also a drop of 3 percentage points from that of the same period in 2023.

For the second quarter of 2024, 41 per cent of employers polled expected headcount to grow, 17 per cent anticipated a decrease and 42 per cent reported no plans to change their headcount.

The proportion of those which expected a decrease in headcount is higher than the 15 per cent in the previous quarter.

Employers in finance and real estate were the most optimistic, with net employment outlook at 45 per cent.

Also anticipating healthy headcount growth are the employers in healthcare and life sciences, which posted a net employment outlook of 36 per cent, and those in energy and utilities, at 33 per cent, the firm noted.

Hiring sentiment improved the most in the energy and utilities sector compared with the previous quarter, growing by 22 percentage points, the firm added.

“Banking and finance companies are seeing a boom in demand for sustainable financing as more businesses take on sustainable loans to support their green transformation,” said Ms Linda Teo, country manager of ManpowerGroup Singapore.

“With Singapore being a leading hub for green finance and carbon trading in Asia and globally, banking and finance companies are actively recruiting talent with environmental, social and corporate governance expertise and qualifications to support their growth in this area.”

1bct95p,kuhyogx,2024-03-12 17:41:32,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Teen admits raping younger sister, among 4 brothers accused of sexually abusing her 

SINGAPORE — An 18-year-old pleaded guilty in the High Court on Tuesday (March 12) to raping his sister when he was aged 13 to 16, often while the younger girl was asleep.

He is the second and youngest of four brothers to admit to sexually abusing their sister, who was eight to 12 years old at the time of the assaults.

Another brother — now aged 20 and the second youngest of the four — pleaded guilty earlier this year. He was the last of the group to begin his sexual assault on the girl.

Both brothers are facing the possibility of reformative training, with judges separately calling for reports to ascertain if they are suitable for it. Reformative training is a regimented rehabilitation programme for offenders under 21 who commit relatively serious crimes.

All four brothers were between the ages of 13 and 21 when they committed the alleged offences against their sister between 2018 and 2022.

The older brothers are now aged 22 and 23 respectively.

The youngest brother pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two counts of aggravated rape, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of eight years’ jail and 12 strokes of the cane.

Another six charges — comprising aggravated rape and sexual assault — will be taken into consideration for sentencing at a later date.

He is defended by Ms Harjeet Kaur from Withers KhattarWong, who sought the reformative training suitability report. The lawyer said in mitigation that her client was remorseful and unlikely to re-offend, and has learned an extremely bitter and painful lesson.

Ms Kaur also told Justice Mavis Chionh that if reformative training is ultimately found not to be appropriate, she is seeking the minimum sentence for rape.

Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPPs) Muhamad Imaduddien, Lim Ying Min and M Kayal Pillay are seeking nine to 10 years’ imprisonment and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane.

They argued that while rehabilitation is generally the primary sentencing consideration for young offenders, deterrence or retribution can take centre stage depending on the circumstances of a case.

They also similarly sought imprisonment and caning for the first brother who pleaded guilty.

The remaining brothers’ cases are pending.

BOYS' AND GIRLS' ROOMS

The court heard that the victim, who is now 14, had four brothers and two sisters. She is the oldest among her sisters.

All seven children lived together with their parents in their family home, which had three bedrooms.

The boys stayed in a bedroom referred to in court documents as the boys' room, while the girls shared the ""girls' room"".

The children's parents set ground rules that the boys were not to go into the girls' room, unless it was to comb their hair using the mirror there.

The reason for this rule was that the three girls were still young while the four boys were mature. Whenever the kids' mother saw one of her sons in the girls' room, she would remind them not to stay inside.

However, the offender would go into the girls' room to sexually assault the victim, even when his other sisters were sleeping there. He also abused the girl in their parents’ room and the boys’ room.

He admitted to doing this at least seven times.

DPP Lim told the court that he had a “porn addiction” and that he “chose” to sexually assault the victim, rather than his other sisters, because he knew she trusted him the most and would not report him to anyone.

He often targeted her while she was asleep. If she woke up, he would tell her to keep quiet and not tell anyone. She would also try to resist by saying “don’t want” or by pushing him away.

On one occasion in 2021, they were alone at home when he called her into the boys’ room and raped her there. He was aged 15 or 16.

Court documents did not state if he knew she was being abused by their other brothers.

VICTIM PRETENDED TO BE HAPPY

Throughout the years of abuse, the victim did not dare to tell anyone. She felt stressed and sad but “would just pretend to be happy by putting on a fake smile”, the court heard.

On Feb 10, 2022, she finally summoned the courage to tell her school about the abuse. It was her dream secondary school as the teachers knew her family, and the offender had also studied there.

The school immediately alerted the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which in turn informed the police. The offender was arrested on the same day.

The girl felt anxious and blamed herself for not stopping her brothers. She also felt bad for reporting them to the authorities, the court further heard.

She was examined by a psychiatrist at the Child Guidance Clinic, who noted that the girl had been having recurrent thoughts about the abuse.

The psychiatrist said the victim would benefit from a safe, supportive environment and counselling.

MOTHER DID NOT BELIEVE VICTIM

She was also referred to MSF’s Clinical and Forensic Psychology Service for an assessment of her emotional and behavioural functioning.

A senior clinical psychologist’s report showed that while she reported having positive relationships with her younger sisters, her relationship with her parents and brothers had been distant since childhood.

Her mother reported that she did not believe the abuse allegations, and expressed feelings of anger and disappointment towards the victim.

She blamed the girl for the consequences of the allegations, including the ""adverse impact"" on the brothers’ futures as well as the removal of one of the sisters from the family, DPP Lim told the court.

Meanwhile, the girl reported trauma symptoms such as hypervigilance and frequent strong feelings of disgust, fear and sadness. She was referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy.

Following her therapy sessions, she displayed significant improvement and appeared to have “adequate wellbeing and functioning”.

Tuesday’s court hearing was held in camera, which meant the proceedings were closed to the public and media.

The court can hear proceedings in private if it is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or for other sufficient reasons. CNA

> I don't see any changes being made to fix the cultural problems that men face

I do actually: more and more discussions on healthy (vs toxic) masculinity; male protagonists in movies/TV are far less likely to be the stereotypical macho male heroes of the past; increasing talk about how men can also be victims of sexual assault/harassment and domestic violence; conversations about male mental health and suicide; movements to increase paternity leave that some countries have implemented; greater awareness of single fathers and the support they need; AWARE advocating for gender-neutral NS; increasing focus on boys falling behind in schools; more men entering jobs previously associated with women, such as nursing and education; a general broadening of hobbies, interests and fashion that were traditionally associated with women but are now also considered acceptable for men.

Diversity hires also benefit many male minorities, as do other diversity initiatives and benefits. Overseas, movements like BLM primarily focus on men.

The problem according to conventional feminist is the patriarchal system. This system harms both men and women. So women support women to deal with harmful patriarchal roles, not to put down men.

Except that feminist movements constantly blame a lot of issues on the patriarchy, in essence the blame is levelled solely on men. It's true that feminism harms both sexes, but not equally; it continues to disadvantage men a lot more than women. And having come out on top in the culture wars in the last few years, feminism has made it a point to ensure that men would not find a safe space in society. 

If I'm being realistic, the hotline for men might not work as well or as effectively as one should anticipate as yet, especially considering not many know of it especially those that would need it but have nowhere to turn.

Then did manicure/ pedicure . Shrinkflation is a bitch … told me if I want color, need to top up money… urgh at least my nails’ dead skin clear , all tidy now (RM $105)

If this were true then women would never have been able to vote since in the past you would have similar percentages thinking that women don't need a vote. You are confusing the status quo with what should happen in the future.

Besides, while Singapore has made progress in recognizing and mitigating the negative effects of a patriarchal system on women, people are only beginning to see the negative ways a patriarchal system affects men. The IPSOS survey question you are referring to asks whether society has done enough for women's equality. It says nothing about combating harmful patriarchal expectations of men.

>Our elites hire maids from the surrounding region. Our PSC scholars do not generally become housewives once they get married. That would be really strange and probably would happen if we are truly living in patriarchy.

I am really not sure what is the value of assessing our society based on how elites behave. People don't observe how Kim Jong Un behaves and say well I guess North Korea is not poor. Besides, tackling your point directly, a patriarchal system can still exist even with women participating in the labour force.

>You are making the assumption, as are many others, that women want to ascend to power as do men. This does not seem to be the case.

But you are assuming that women's choices are entirely independent of gender roles in society. It's the same thing as men being the primary breadwinner for most families - I would point out that men are pressured by society to be providers and protectors which is why they end up being the working spouse. You would say... men choose to do that?

>I'd argue 30% is still a figure that does not indicate unfair dominance.

I think you have a very unique concept of what is unfair when you think a 2:1 imbalance is not unfair.

>Traditionally, men ask and women answer. If women start to ask, I'm sure men would gladly answer. ;)

Come now, we both know that this is not true. Current society is what it is, house husbands are rare (if not made fun of). As I said, in the IPSOS survey, a depressing high (32%) of men agreed that a man who stays home to look after his children is less of a man.

>High calibre women will have to start proposing marriage to lower calibre men

This is not the issue. Between equally capable spouses, if a child comes along or if someone needs to focus on domestic duties, most of the time it will be the woman.

>I refer to the Singaporean deference to authority.

I have doubts, since I don't understand why you would have originally said ""I don't think we can assume we do live in patriarchy. Male-dominated and confucian-inspired, sure."". You seemed to be making a point about gender roles at very least in a Confucian system, because simply referring to deference to authority there seems very strange.

But if you want to clarify your point as only referring to deference to authority, I have to point out that Confucian values are quite clear on which gender is going to hold that authority. So I question the practicality of trying to argue that Singapore apparently has received a deference to authority from Confucian values, but somehow not left out the gendered nature of the source of authority.

And even then, assuming that Singapore somehow received a gender neutral concept of deference from Confucian values, if we live in a male dominated society, how does that help your argument? It would mean that we live in a male dominated society where men hold the power, and where society is naturally deferential to that power held by men. I feel like we are just describing a patriarchal system with extra steps.",48% of S’poreans believe promoting women’s equality has become discrimination against men: Ipsos study,Singapore,1237.0,0.92,2024-03-14,no

If by 3rd month no progress then is an issue but you did have progress which she failed to notice. Don’t let this affect your confidence OP, boss sounds like a bully who has no idea of the difference and quality between someone with 1 year experience vs someone with 5. This just goes to show they look down on salaried workers and a lack of appreciation for their job function which is a sign that you wont get to grow or progress far in your time there anyway.

I have some personal experience with this, so let me share my own perspective. I, too, have seriously considered renouncing my religion. But I've decided to call myself non practicing instead. To me, the grief, disappointment and consequences of renouncing it is simply not worth it, given I can practically live how I want for 99% of my life regardless. All renouncing does is to emphasize to your family (not just parents, but also relatives, etc) that you are so strongly against Islam that you're willing to sacrifice your ties with your family.

Is there a trade off? Yes. For me, I still love my fam and I also live with my parents. I respect that at home and when I'm with them, it's all halal food and no alcohol. When they are fasting, I try my best not to eat in front of them. I do these both out of respect, and I feel it's a small sacrifice. But we all know that I neither fast nor eat only halal food. 

I hope you consider what specifically your bf is asking you to do, whether it's reasonable or not. If it's literally just in front of his family, then treat it as doing something out of respect for them. It isn't lying. Lying implies that the other party is being deceived. No one is deceiving anyone here. He is pretending to be practicing, they are pretending that he is practicing. 

The social media part is strange, just block them? It's also a bit strange that he's asking you to ""pretend to fast"". What does that mean? And it is fairly common to not fast, or at least skip some days, even for practicing Muslims. Just say you're not feeling well that day, or in your period, or many other reasons not to fast.

Talk it out with him, about what your boundaries on what you're willing to do. If he really is an atheist in all but name, I'm sure there is room for compromise here.

\#3 is premised on the condition that any divorce doesn't turn ugly. I can think of three common reasons divorce turns ugly: spousal abuse, finances and children.  Make sure you really date a person for long enough to know the real them, maybe even live together for a bit before marriage, to try to said abusive spouses.  Don't ignore warning signs like a lot of people do.  Regarding finances, prenups (if valid in Singapore) and keeping your finances mostly separate may help.

A lot of people here seem to do thinks without thinking if that's what they want. Like just take a look at uni students and majority of them have no idea what they want to do with their degree. It's even worse when their reason for doing something is because other people do so too.

Like ask people why they want to earn more money, they will say it is because Singapore is expensive. But if you do a cost analysis in Singapore, we aren't that different in the region when it comes to our ratio of cost. In fact other places tend to have high cost than us in relation to their income. Like the fact that we can have enough money to eat at resturants every week, that is something your average Thai salary worker won't be able to do. They would have to make far above their median pay to live a similar lifestyle to us.

So while a $5 caifan is more expensive than a 80 baht kaprow mu, in relative terms to our income, we pay far less. And I think that's just one pressure, because we assume Singapore is expensive so when something is expensive we just assume that it has to be then simply pay without thinking.

And when you extrapolate that line of thinking to every aspect of our lives, it's not that difficult to understand why we are all so depressed, everyone out here doing things they don't believe in and can't back out because they are too deep to do so.",What’s something you wish to normalise in Singapore?,askSingapore,1063.0,0.95,2024-03-13,no

while it may be a stable career, you lose control of your career path/progression. 

you can’t really change jobs unless you are a scholar or specialise in something. i’ve seen CPT’s in their 40’s and LTA’s in their 30’s because they fucked up really bad or just didn’t pursue a degree. changing to private sector would most likely result in a huge pay cut. 

the regulars who decided to leave usually went to sales, although we all know they mean insurance/real estate agent.

even if you stay for 40 years, you will change units every 2-3 years, and each unit will have a vastly different work life balance, culture, and office politics.

I’m not sure what you consider a “teacher” in your responses but my cousin is a public school teacher and is making in the ballpark of 85k not including bonuses, has under ten years of experience, and drives a nice car. He’s as average as they come. 

To your point about not having options outside of a corporate job, my takeaway from the responses here is quite different from yours, but I’d point out that you’re again making a meaningless comparison - we don’t have the option of making bank in trades, so why would you make that comparison? I’d argue that people who don’t want a corporate job in Singapore have the option of starting their own businesses, and many do in fact do that. Off the top of my head a lot of people who only graduated the SG equivalent of high school start their own trading or wholesale goods companies and make a ton of money, like tradesmen in Australia. 

We should also take into account the fact that certain industries pay more in some societies and less in others, the education sector being one of those industries - Singaporean society simply does not value preschool teachers as much as Australian society. Look at high finance on the other hand and most Australians would stab a baby for a chance at a senior role in Singapore because income after tax will be much higher than back home. 

But my point is that there will always be anecdotal “evidence” to suggest this or that. But generally speaking, most people with ten years of experience and a degree would be making more than the median wage in Singapore.

Also, even if OP has been here “long enough” to understand some vulgarities, it does not imply that OP takes public transport.

You're not allowed to withdraw from it until a certain age (if I'm not mistaken). So if you get warded, you can use your medisave to pay. 


Secondly, Singaporeans get medical subsidies. If you get a referral from a polyclinic to go to a public hospital, you get a larger subsidy. This applies to everyone regardless of income. 


If your family income is low, you can apply for a CHAS card. Showing this card allows you to get even more subsidies. So the lower your income, the more subsidies you get on your medical bills.


There's also medifund. If after all of that you really cannot afford your medical bills, you'll get financial assistance. 


And if you really default on your bills, public hospitals still won't stop giving you medical assistance.

Back-dating in general can fall under fraud or cheating, i.e. the date given does not reflect the facts. Doctors, just like any other professionals and laypersons, can get into trouble if someone files a complaint with their professional associations e.g. Singapore Medical Council.

This is what I got from ChatGPT based on the prompt, ""Is it illegal to backdate medical certificates in Singapore""

Reply by ChatGPT:

As of my last update in January 2022, it's essential to emphasize that I'm not a lawyer, and my responses shouldn't be considered legal advice. However, I can provide some general information.

In Singapore, as in many jurisdictions, backdating medical certificates can be considered unethical and potentially illegal. Medical certificates are legal documents issued by licensed medical practitioners to certify that a person is ill or unfit for work or school for a specific period. Backdating such certificates, altering dates after the fact to make it appear as though the person was ill on a prior date when they were not, can constitute fraud or forgery.

Engaging in such activities can lead to serious consequences, including legal penalties, professional disciplinary action for the medical practitioner involved, and potential termination of employment for the individual presenting the backdated certificate. Additionally, it undermines the integrity of the medical certification system and can have broader implications for public trust in healthcare professionals.

It's always best to comply with the law and ethical standards in such matters. If you have concerns or questions about medical certificates or related legal issues in Singapore, it's advisable to consult with a qualified legal professional or seek guidance from relevant authorities.",Extending MC but backdating (?6,askSingapore,1.0,0.66,2024-03-13,no

It is ramadan now. I visit my family with my husband once a week for a maximum of two hours. My parents are more tired this month so we don't go out as a family much at all. If my husband were to be upset for just having to abstain for food and water for 2 hours, I'd be pretty upset about the unwillingness to compromise honestly. I participate in plenty of Chinese customs during the cny period as well, memorise alot of new years greetings and gamble even though I am personally against that. My husband does not believe in Buddhism at all but he accompanies his parents to the temple because he loves them.  

About eating halal food, this one is kinda ridiculous I will not lie to you. This is just for when you are around his family right? You can eat non-halal food together/on your own on literally any other occasion. Not to mention, this is Singapore. Sure we aren't a Muslim majority but if you are with his family, there are plenty of halal food options. When we are with my husbands family we do not eat beef our of respect for his parents' believes in Buddhism. But this weekend, we will be making a non-halal steak for dinner for just the 2 of us. 

And yes, my husband lies for me and I in turn lie for hin too. When we talk to our parents about our meals, it's just fish/chicken/vegetarian. As for the social media, fine that's kind of unreasonable. But in the first place why did you let his family members follow you/why is your social media public in this day and age?

For our wedding we will have both Chinese and Malay Muslim aspects. We will likely have a very small and very private nikah ceremony and tea ceremony as well. My husband will not convert to Islam and I will not renounce my legal faith as well. We are free to live our lives however we want except for the 2 hours in our entire week where we visit my parents because I love them and still want to have a decent relationship with them. I may not have tattoos but I have never paid zakat before, I've stopped praying, I've never been to hajj. 

Op, maybe I'm being biased but if the two of you deeply love each other, these compromises are very very small. On the other hand you want him to come out to his family. As other commenter have said, this will have a much bigger impact on his life. He might be disowned, if his social circle is all Muslim he will lose all of his friends too.

You are not being unreasonable at all for wanting to break up, I even encourage it. But please don't try to make your boyfriend come out to his family since you are so unwilling to be understanding. It is your choice ultimately if you don't want to compromise, I can only wish you and your boyfriend well for your futures and I hope the 2 of you will meet people who are willing to compromise for you and meet you in the middle for the sake of love.","Is it wrong to leave an ex-Muslim for refusing to ""come out"" to his family?",askSingapore,260.0,0.88,2024-03-14,no

And then I had 2 more years to learn how to troubleshoot. So, 3 years until I was considered an independent employee who doesn't need a senior to carry the shift.  A few years back, they threw a new guy at me and asked me to train him to be independent in 6 months. I tried my best, but it's simply not possible. They moved him to a different shift, and a couple of years later, he was fired for not meeting expectations because frankly, his training wasn't complete. Then last week, my boss threw another one at me and asked me to make him ready in 3 months. Lol. I'm starting to believe that bosses these days believe their job is to say words. They don't really care if the reality disagrees. They will bullshit their way to a promotion and disappear from office within a few years, leaving the place worse off than they found it.

In your case, just do your best. Don't need to work hard for a boss who doesn't value you or gives you empty words. If you have any leave left, use them.

I would speak to him to see if you can compromise.

There literally are social services dedicated to teens/young adults who decide to shut themselves in their rooms for many years, in SG. Many of them are STILL in their rooms leh. I know of one who took 10 years before they decided to leave. 

I honestly think that it is utterly amazing that you got yourself out. 6 years is nothing and you definitely have a future ahead of you. 

Don’t beat yourself up over the past or feel bad, i think you’re amazing k? You job hunted and got a job. Even if you don’t like it, you’ll move on eventually! 

Try to do your best each day and also job hunt nearer your notice date. Start giving your parents a small allowance now if you can afford to do so. Don’t feel bad about the past, you can’t go back and you can’t change it, you can only do your best from now on. Mental health is hard so don’t blame past you. 

It would have been a lot worse if you gambled, stole from parents, took drugs for the past 6 years or went prison. Would have broken your parents’ heart. So far you quite harmless lah.

In the same post, you also mentioned that 

>Problem is I now have a girlfriend who's local, we're not willing to do long distance and not been together long enough to consider marriage

8 months later (2 months ago), you posted about proposing

I assume that between then and now, you have proposed, and your gf accepted, because around the same time, you posted about applying for PMLA.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/191lyz1/question\_on\_pmla\_ltvp\_and\_engagement\_and\_marriage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/191lyz1/question_on_pmla_ltvp_and_engagement_and_marriage/)

What changed in the short span of 8 months that changed you and your gf's mind to consider marriage?

Not to mention that in one of your comments recently (3 hours ago), you basically haven't gotten a job since last being laid off last year.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1b1v2hd/comment/kutqmon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1b1v2hd/comment/kutqmon/)

So while being unemployed for about 10 months, you and your gf go from ""not being together long enough to consider marriage"" to ""being engaged and applying for PMLA""?

And you wonder why your PMLA got rejected? 

>we did the PMLA together and got rejected to my surprise.

From the government's pov, why would they consider giving PMLA to a foreigner who isn't working and contributing to Singapore's society. Put it this way, if a proposal/engagement was all that was necessary for a PMLA, any foreigner can propose or be proposed to, get one foot into Singapore, then apply for LTVP before finally applying for PR, all while not contributing to Singapore's economy.

And to top it all off, 

>Should I just call the wedding off and end the relationship?

Personally to me, this coupled with your previous posts about going from not considering marriage to proposing in the span of 8 months, could be an indicator that your issue is more about getting a job (here in Singapore), rather than settling down with your gf. 

Which I frankly feel, is actually not wrong. You SHOULD be thinking about your finances before even considering marriage. Is your gf/future wife suppose to support you while you continue looking for a job?

My personal opinion, to ""Should I just call the wedding off and end the relationship?"". Yeah. Maybe seriously consider that, both for your and her sake. Because it seems like your priority is not the relationship. And I would agree if that's the case.
