1b3jd2m,ksson6j,2024-03-01 02:47:18,SG_wormsbot,"Title: For whom are we defending Singapore? Heng Chee How asks after Gerald Giam suggests changing NS allowance to NS salary, Singapore News 

For whom are we defending this country? Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How posed this question in Parliament on Wednesday (Feb 29).

""Is it for the Ministry of Defence? For the Singapore Armed Forces? No, it's for each and every Singaporean, for now and for the future,"" he said in his ministry's budget debate.

Earlier on, Workers' Party MP Gerald Giam said that the current philosophy of giving full-time National Servicemen (NSF) an allowance for basic upkeep needs to be reviewed.

This is in light of the ""significant increase"" in cost of living and the opportunity cost of doing two years of national service, he said.

""As a first step, the terminology should be changed from 'NS allowance' to 'NS salary' and it should attract CPF contributions,"" Giam suggested, adding that the median annual salary should be at least the local qualifying salary of $1,600 a month.

""This does not in any way diminish the ethos of national service, just because we pay our NSFs fairly,"" he emphasised.

In response, SMS Heng said that national service is a duty to the country, and not a form of employment.

""Instead of a salary, NSFs receive an allowance to support their basic upkeep and this allowance is regularly reviewed — most recently in July 2023,"" he added.

He pointed out that the NSFs' allowance has been reviewed four times in the last 10 years.

""We will continue to review to make sure that the allowance will remain relevant,"" SMS Heng said.

Seeking clarification on SMS Heng's explanation that NS is ""a duty to country and not employment"", Giam asked: ""However, does the SMS agree that two are not mutually exclusive?""

""SAF regulars for example, they are both employees and serving their national duty.

""But that does not detract, in any way, their sense of national duty.""

Emphasising that he supports national service, Giam reiterated that the NS allowance should ""reflect the realities of the opportunity costs that national servicemen have to incur.""

While national is a duty of citizens to protect Singapore, SMS Heng said, NSFs are not enlisted as volunteers.

""We recognise that we will call on their time for two years. And that during this period, they will need a basic upkeep as they fulfil this duty to Singapore,"" he said.

""This is why we regularly update and enhance the allowance that we pay to our national servicemen.""

Last May, the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs announced that all national servicemen in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force will receive a raise in their monthly allowance starting from July.

The amount ranged from $125 to $200, depending on their rank and vocation. This was an increment by between 10.9 per cent and 21.7 per cent, the ministries added.

One was talking about how they’d manage to get their son complete exemption and how he was going on to a top uni this year. Others were asking for tips on how to get their sons exemptions. Everyone knew full well what they were doing, but everyone also put their sons first.

In the workplace, I have coworkers who actively brainstorm about how to get their soon-to-be-awarded-PR sons out of the country by 10 or 11 to avoid the dreaded draft. Yes, PRs and new citizens who themselves avoided NS trying to help their sons do the same. Heck, don’t even get me started on the expat boss who jokingly said that he’d hire foreigners over citizens to avoid the annual ICT burden.

But can you really blame these people? Ministers can quip all they want about how NS is a duty (lol) but these people can see NS for what it is - a liability. And these are smart and successful people, whose sons will probably go on to reap the economic benefits of having skipped NS to become equally smart and successful.

So cut the bullshit. When you have people who have the means sparing no effort to help their offspring avoid this waste of 2 years - aka a liability - you know the system is broken. But obviously you keep the ones you can control, average citizens without the means, captive in this broken system, talk them down into subservience, and maybe once in a while extol the supposed benefits of NS.

Why do you think that there are so many melancholic statements out there like ""jobs are for foreigners, NS for sinkies"".

Furthermore, many corporates AND Singaporeans of the opposite sex treat males as such. For example, most corporates offer the same pay structure for males and females and while that is fair at most other places, it is less so in Singapore due to the fact that every single male will always lose out to females in terms of career experience due to them having a 2 year head start along with the fact that works gets constantly disrupted due to reservist. As for females, why else do many females aspire to date expats? Obviously, I don't speak for all of them but a vast majority of them aim to do so. That is also why many guys kinda gave up and either remain single or look for a foreigner wife which is why there is a [rise in foreign brides in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/foreign-brides-are-getting-older-and-more-educated-msf-data-released-for-the-first-time).

Why do NSFs not deserve a dignified wage? Why only an allowance for basic personal upkeep? Why is the burden of defence disproportionately levied upon a small segment of the population? Does SMS Chee not understand the basic economic concept of opportunity cost?

Moreover, other countries also pay their servicemen better than the SAF:

- Switzerland has a “loss of income scheme” compensating enlistees a minimum of 62 swiss francs (S$95) a day. Or $1,900/month assuming 20 working days.

If AWARE believes women shouldn't serve, they should say so and admit that there are biological differences in suitability for certain jobs, including the military. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, this is a viewpoint I personally hold.

If they think women should serve, then go actually advocate for it.

1b3jd2m,kszbcn3,2024-03-02 09:20:48,jmzyn,"Ok I found it on some obscure forum. And it was to then SM Goh

Final-year aerospace engineering student Lim Zi Rui, 23, stood up during the Nanyang Technological University Ministerial Forum last night and asked: Did Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong know many young people no longer felt a sense of ownership in Singapore?

His question was one of several posed during the dialogue with Mr Goh, which ranged far and wide over ageing issues, art, even student accommodation.

'When I was younger, I was very proud of being a Singaporean,' Mr Lim said. 'But that was about five, 10 years ago. Five years later, with all the changes in policies and the influx of foreign talent, I really don't know what I'm defending any more.'

He said he was reflecting a sentiment held by many of his men in the SAF, who had to compete with foreigners for jobs. 'I feel that there is a dilution of the Singapore spirit in youth... We don't really feel comfortable in our country any more.'

Mr Goh's reply was one of deep concern. 'This is one early sign of danger... If this is happening, it is very serious.'

He asked Mr Lim why he felt disconnected.

Mr Lim assured SM Goh that he was still keen to fight for Singapore: 'I'm still serving as an officer and I definitely would love to defend Singapore.'

However, he compared his attitude to that of the foreign friends he had. 'I tell them, this is my country. I can't just leave here whenever I want to. You can come and play and work here, but I have to stay here.'

SM Goh responded with a defence of the Government's open-door policy. 'You want to have a home. Who's going to build your HDB flat?'

'My brother got engaged, but lost his engagement because he could not afford an HDB flat,' Mr Lim countered.

'Without foreign workers in Singapore, would your hall of residence be built?' SM Goh asked. 'If we totally reject foreigners, we're going to shrink in size... I don't think Singaporeans want that. What they want is to moderate the inflow of foreigners.'

He also said Singapore had to find ways to integrate foreigners. 'There are many of them who would like to be Singaporeans, and those of them who can be integrated, make them Singaporeans, make them part of us, make them help to defend the country,' he said.

Mr Lim said that his concerns were somewhat different. 'My question was, how are we going to help the younger generation feel a sense of belonging to Singapore? I don't think it's about integrating foreigners.'

'This is your country,' SM Goh replied. 'What do you want me to do to make you feel you belong?'

'For my part, don't worry about me,' Mr Lim said. 'I will definitely do something, if I can, for Singapore. But I can tell you honestly that the sentiment on the ground is a bit different.'

'If that is prevalent among young people over here, we've got a real problem,' SM Goh said. 'If the majority feel they don't belong here, then we have a fundamental problem. Then I would ask myself: What am I doing here? Why should I be working for people who don't feel they belong over here?'

'this is one early sign of danger... if this is happening, it is very serious.'he asked mr lim why he felt disconnected.mr lim assured sm goh that he was still keen to fight for singapore: 'i'm still serving as an officer and i definitely would love to defend singapore.'however, he compared his attitude to that of the foreign friends he had. 'i tell them, this is my country. i can't just leave here whenever i want to. you can come and play and work here, but i have to stay here.'sm goh responded with a defence of the government's open-door policy. 'you want to have a home. who's going to build your hdb flat?''my brother got engaged, but lost his engagement because he could not afford an hdb flat,' mr lim countered.'without foreign workers in singapore, would your hall of residence be built?' sm goh asked. 'if we totally reject foreigners, we're going to shrink in size... i don't think singaporeans want that. what they want is to moderate the inflow of foreigners.'he also said singapore had to find ways to integrate foreigners. 'there are many of them who would like to be singaporeans, and those of them who can be integrated, make them singaporeans, make them part of us, make them help to defend the country,' he said.mr lim said that his concerns were somewhat different. 'my question was, how are we going to help the younger generation feel a sense of belonging to singapore? i don't think it's about integrating foreigners.''this is your country,' sm goh replied. 'what do you want me to do to make you feel you belong?''for my part, don't worry about me,' mr lim said. 'i will definitely do something, if i can, for singapore. but i can tell you honestly that the sentiment on the ground is a bit different.''if that is prevalent among young people over here, we've got a real problem,' sm goh said. 'if the majority feel they don't belong here, then we have a fundamental problem. then i would ask myself: what am i doing here? why should i be working for people who don't feel they belong over here?'",for whom are we defending singapore? heng chee how asks after gerald giam suggests changing ns allowance to ns salary

SINGAPORE - Bubble tea chain iTEA will be taking down an advertisement that appeared to promote drinks like pearl milk tea as zero-sugar and zero-calorie.

The brand, which has 47 outlets islandwide, apologised for its mistake and said there was no intent to mislead consumers.

A brand spokesman said its claim was referring to its new sugar substitute, and not meant to create the impression that its drinks were zero-calorie.

But the advertisements, which had been up at 12 of the brand’s outlets since January 2024, had baffled consumers with its confusing and seemingly contradictory claims.

The promotion poster depicts three drinks – jasmine green tea, pearl milk tea and matcha latte with azuki beans – with text on the advertisement saying that there’s zero sugar, zero calories and zero guilt, which is applicable for all drinks.

Dr Max Seah, 35, who works in artificial intelligence, spotted the poster at the outlet in 205 Bedok North Street 1 on Jan 26 while he was waiting for his child’s vaccination to be done at the nearby polyclinic.

“I thought it was bad marketing because it’s blatantly untrue that pearl milk tea and matcha latte can have zero calories,” said Dr Seah.

He added: “If I buy a drink, I’ll not base it on any of their claims. If I get a milk tea, I’ll treat it like any milk tea I can get at any other shop. I’ll just pretend their poster doesn’t exist.”

Consumers were also perplexed by the Nutri-Grade ratings of the drinks on the poster.

Its pearl milk tea is rated C with 0 per cent sugar, and its matcha latte with azuki beans is rated C with 4 per cent sugar.

Mrs Sally Lee, 50, who works in the gas energy sector, did a double take when she had a closer look at the poster while she was waiting for her drink at iTEA’s Admiralty Place outlet.

“If the pearl milk tea has 0 per cent sugar, why is it rated C?” said Mrs Lee.

Drinks in the C range have between 5g and 10g of sugar per 100ml, or 1.2g to 2.8g of saturated fat per 100ml.

A drink’s Nutri-Grade rating is based on the highest sugar content offered by the brand. If the drink comes with toppings like pearls or jellies by default, the sugar content in the toppings are counted towards the drink’s Nutri-Grade rating.

1b3mech,kst98g6,2024-03-01 05:23:00,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice 

SINGAPORE: Sometimes I find myself wishing I was raising my kids in an earlier era. No, this is not a sop to simpler times gone by - with more gendered social scripts and much greater poverty. But, I wonder if there are ideas from the past we can revive and combine with our modern nous, if we are to be a society that not only desires children, but has them too.

Fertility rates are dropping across most advanced economies, with Singapore’s resident total fertility rate (TFR) falling below 1 for the first time in 2023, to 0.97. A total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is needed to sustain a population.

In a poll conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), when we asked survey respondents what makes them not want to have kids, unsurprisingly, the expense and stress of having children were the top reasons.

This is despite the government deploying policy after policy over the last decade to make parenting more affordable. The new Budget introduces additional fee caps in government-supported preschools, with further reductions slated for 2026. The aim is to make preschool fees comparable to the combined fees of primary school and after-school care.

Nonetheless, parents understandably gripe that more should be done. We still do not have equal parental leave for mothers and fathers. And what we do have feels insufficient in terms of the crucial first 18 months of a child’s life and the context of dual careers. Free education and healthcare are also not features of our system.

Yet, despite significantly addressing all of the above and enjoying a reputation as a haven for pro-parenting policies, the Nordic region experienced a falling TFR over the last decade: Between 7 per cent in Denmark and 25 per cent in Finland. One possible response to this would be to question the point of these pro-family accommodations.

A more nuanced approach would acknowledge that sustaining increased birth rates is a mighty quandary. There is no way of knowing that fertility rates would not drop even more sharply without policy interventions. Yet, policies that alleviate the burdens of parenthood are not enough. We must develop both the financial accommodations and collective psyche for greater child-rearing.

Agreed. Teaching people how to resist social pressure regarding productivity, and/or reforming society, is important if we want to raise birth rates.

Personally I find that my social status cannot be threatened. If someone tells me, ""what if your 3 kids lower your productivity at work?"", I'll laugh it off.

1b3mech,ksxv2gf,2024-03-02 01:22:41,Kyokonizu,"Singapore is definitely feeling the crunch and at this pace, we are moving towards those of Japan and S. Korea which is bad.

In my opinion, like many others here, the main reasons why people do not want kids is because of the expected costs associated with kids. 

Being a parent, you always want to give the best you can for your kids. If not, you might feel that you have not provided enough (or at least give your kid the best chance) to win in life in the future. That’s a really scary thought isn’t it, if everyone else have this and that, but if you never provide for ‘this and that’ then ultimately your kids lose out and the future may not be as bright. 

Costs in Singapore is rising so much, even hawker centre prices are going up (albeit slowly), housing is getting more expensive because of the fact there’s no control on developers pushing prices up (buy, rebuilt, resell: their biz model, that’s why your houses getting smaller. Divide more can sell more) so surrounding area housing prices also will shoot up. 

If housing is expensive, how are the citizens encouraged to get a place that is “fit” to have children? Need at least 4RM which is costly. And there is no policy to help these families bridge into a bigger place (need to sell to down pay for the new house) so this is definitely a big consideration. Gov should step in and make this transition (either through grants, priority, gov int free loan are some suggestions) 

There’s also the expectation of time commitment to care for the kid. Working culture in Asia suck, there is little to no work life balance. We are all at the mercy of our employers. Because as a society, we are chasing GDP at the expense of our citizens.  We don’t even have much time to ourselves, how to have time for kids? OT culture is expected too, becomes the norm and then people turn into workaholics out of fear. 

This needs to change, some sacrifice of GDP may be necessary. This is top down from gov policy (just see what Australia did with the passing of law where employer cannot contact employees after a certain time). This stronghold maybe the necessary evil to provide a better work-life balance, with this, people may start to see life isn’t that bad and then want to have kids. Anyway, you can also increase GDP with a higher fertility rate, cause with more people, they spend more :) 

With a lot of foreigners coming into our little red dot also begets the question of why the need for those coming in as fresh grads? I understand we need foreign talents with experience but those at the start of their careers shouldn’t qualify as talent. This competition also makes people feel like their future kids have a lot of competition even for jobs. Like I have a couple of foreigner friends that started their careers in SG, did not serve NS. After a couple of years either become PR or Citizen. Mind you, they are way ahead in terms of careers than most of us that did NS. And…best, they don’t need to do reservice…so why do our kids have to suffer for these people? An idea is to make these newly minted PR, citizen compulsory to serve in volunteer core. If S.korea can delay and make citizen serve at 28-30, why not these people too? 


Another reason is the lack of convenience due to rising costs like vehicles. COE is so bloody expensive, and that’s actually a need for most couples with children. Going to the hospital, going to school etc need a car for sure. Encouraging people to have kids must also provide for the infrastructure behind this. What gov can do to encourage people to have kids is to allocate a portion of the COE to parents with kids (1-9 years old). These are the people who need it most, not the rich ones that have 6x - 9x cars sitting at home doing jack shit. 

Tax relief needs to improve for parents too, it’s already very expensive to bring up a kid. $3k/month doesn’t cut it for a child’s upbringing that may cost more than $1m. 

The people in power also need to walk the talk and lead by example. Since they have the economic ability to do so, they should market themselves to encourage more people to have kids… cannot be encourage citizens to have kids then we suffer ma.. we need role models.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for making all sorts of personal sacrifices: career, time, material comforts etc.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for the sort of dysfunctional families that many grew up in and an unwillingness to project existing trauma and insecurities onto kids.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for having kids as investment vehicles or retirement income sources. Some people don’t make enough for this not to be an issue.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for what they consider regressive customs or groups like polygamy or religious cults of procreation.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for the ever-accelerating rat race, and a desire not to subject kids to it.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for having kids merely out of a fear of loneliness or having no one at your deathbed.

For some, it’s a vote of no confidence for our present inability to correct genetic defects and the potential birth of kids that inherit all sorts of incurable illnesses. This not an abhorrence of weakness. It is precisely kindness to these children to spare them from cruel competition against the healthy for which they will invariably suffer a great deal with practically no chance of coming out ahead. Forrest Gump is a movie, not reality.

The refusal to compromise is a simple one: the better educated in more developed places have principles. Many will choose not bring kids into the world without a good chance of a great life for everyone physically, mentally, materially. Perfectionists do not settle for less. Poor people who breed like livestock today are unprincipled, and so it is that much unnecessary trauma and suffering will continue for at least a few more generations.

Another thing old people can’t seem to comprehend is young people do not believe in suffering for suffering’s sake. It’s an entirely different mindset. Yes, there will always be a place for heroism in our culture but there is much more to life than to glorify sacrifices.

There is possibly a permanent solution in the long run to reversing the birth rate decline and it’s not throwing more money at the problem or reintroducing polygamy or converting everyone to a monotheistic faith.

I am just stating what needs to be done if Singapore actually wanted to get locals above replacement rate, and why its never going to happen.

Well there are other options, equally unpalatable

1b3mech,kt1lase,2024-03-02 19:42:07,loupblanc10kai,"I was lazy to reply just now. Actually, even if by magic, from next year all child-related costs (from when baby come out until age 16 when baby has grown up and can make babies) ends up being heavily subsidized by government, it will have exactly zero impact on people in SG (from age 16-40) in whether they will want to have babies.

Work-related issues + $ issues preventing people from wanting babies is an **external** matter. **Internally**, people just either don't want babies at all or at most want just 1 baby (and maybe keep the 2nd baby if there is an accident). The mentality of entire generations having less internal desire to need/want to  get married/have babies/start family started when the working economy changed from a single-income household to dual-income household.

1b3mech,kt3pbvf,2024-03-03 03:59:08,anakinmcfly,"> Did guys have a choice when they go ns? 

No, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? Your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. It's not a solution. It just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. Just make girls do NS too and solve everything.

> What if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?

Some of those are covered by the PES system. There can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. Likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. It also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.

> Many not suited for parents? But many still are

This also depends a lot on who their partner is. Raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. That will mean a Singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.

It *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. Do you really believe that every single guy in Singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes NS? And if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?

NS lasts two years plus reservist. It's most similar to a manual labour job. It is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.

I feel sorry for your wife and kids. (at least, I assume you're married with kids, since from your profile you're 24 years old, and you think it just takes 2 years to find a partner and marry them. You've had 4 years since your NS ended.)","Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice",263,0.95,2024-03-03,No,1026,No,0,"> did guys have a choice when they go ns? no, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. it's not a solution. it just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. just make girls do ns too and solve everything.> what if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?some of those are covered by the pes system. there can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. it also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.> many not suited for parents? but many still arethis also depends a lot on who their partner is. raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. that will mean a singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.it *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. do you really believe that every single guy in singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes ns? and if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?ns lasts two years plus reservist. it's most similar to a manual labour job. it is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.i feel sorry for your wife and kids.

Very much no - what if it was rape? Or a regular abusive relationship that cannot be proved, where the guy intentionally tricked her into getting pregnant because he wanted kids and she didn’t? Or if they just don’t know who the father is…

Meanwhile the issue isn’t lack of desire. I have many friends who want kids but can’t afford them (especially the sandwich generation who also have to look after our aging parents), or who are unable to find a partner, or too gay.

I've encountered people like this in Singapore and other countries who threaten aggression and/or violence towards me. I think the important part is taking emotion out of it and recognising my personal choice to de-escalate. 

We *could* have escalated but made the explicit choice not to, which is completely fine. Things to consider like what if the uncle got physically violent towards you, what if he had a weapon, could you defend yourself against him alone, if not, what if nobody stands up to help you?

Walking away removes all these what-ifs and prioritises your safety, so it's a great decision imo. 99% of people I know who have trained in any real martial art will choose to walk away for these reasons. So despite choosing not to engage, you shouldn't think of yourself as a victim, rather a smart person who actively made the choice to de-escalate.

I also feel shaken up after these experiences but I hope you can find solace in knowing that you made an intelligent decision despite being under pressure in a dangerous situation

Though it is good that you had the tenacity to reflect and got angry not standing up enough for yourself, please do remember to be kind to yourself and try not to ponder on it too much. 



I also once had an experience where I was 17-19 years old at a polyclinic, and a man in his 30s(?) was so insistent on having a conversation with me while waiting for the doctor. The conversation went on because I froze up and wasn't sure what to do.

1b3pt0y,kstxcdm,2024-03-01 09:50:53,Ran-Rii,"I bring an alternative viewpoint to the one preached by the government narrative: no, it is not easy to learn new skills as an adult. I have worked at a university that caters to adult learning with part-time courses. It is genuinely hellish. Students need to juggle work commitments with course assignments and it is genuinely a superhuman task to juggle your job, your studies and your sustenance activities (eating/sleeping) within your limited 24 hours.


Your living standard plummets DRAMATICALLY if you attempt to learn new skills, especially outside of your physical prime (late 10s ~ early 30s).  It is not wrong to acknowledge limitations. Don't be daft. It is the government and the entitled rich who can live on their savings while they pick up new skills that find upskilling manageable. They are generalising their experience onto the multitude of average Singaporeans who will find it extremely difficult to juggle upskilling and job commitments.


Singapore is alienating its elderly by forcing the switch to digitisation while not having adequate preservation of legacy systems to cater to our elderly.

Both having only graduated primary school, and while my mother learnt enough English to be literate, my father is still below the literacy level. 

They are over the age of 60, and were born and raised in an old village before moving into a flat. They are not high achievers, with my mother and father both working factory jobs, and when they had me, my mother became a housewife and my father worked as a Shell grunt, before changing to work as a security guard in recent years.

I am telling you the gist of my parents, not to spin a tale, but to tell you that these old fashioned folks of mine have learnt and are still learning to adapt to the modern world. The older generation *CAN* adapt to newer things. With the older generation, yes they will be slow to pick up new things. But if they have the willingness to learn, they WILL learn it. And they WILL utilise it well.

My parents are extremely slow in learning these things, and yet now I am extremely proud of them. 

My mother is adapt at typing, has owned laptops, and even the first generation iPhone she bought out of curiosity. She is adept at finding new things, and making it work until she genuinely doesn't know how. Pinterest, Imgur, Dropbox etc.

My father understands that he's illiterate in English, so what does he do? He tries to change the language of everything he can to Malay. If he can't, he'll ask me. He doesn't really understand accounts all that well, but he understands how to operate a browser, social media and other relevant stuff.

Both of them are well aware of the dangers of surfing the net through me drilling it into their heads, scam calls and SMS, etc. They are well versed in the important apps, like Sunglass or their banking apps, and know how to operate them though they sometimes need a little guidance. They know how to skip the queue with online apps, paying and/or topping up with their debit card and even know how to shop online.

1b3pu5p,kstteax,2024-03-01 09:01:12,SG_wormsbot,"Title: To Batam, to Johor, before Singapore: South-east Asia’s Swifties go the extra mile  

JAKARTA – Thousands of Taylor Swift fans from South-east Asia will be converging on Singapore by plane, bus and even boat, as the singer’s Eras Tour approaches this weekend, beginning on March 2.

With a total of more than 300,000 tickets sold for six concerts at the National Stadium, overseas fans have already snapped up plane tickets and hotel accommodation in Singapore.

But others are taking more unconventional routes.

To save on transport and accommodation, some Swifties – as the American singer-songwriter’s fans are called – will be staying in nearby Batam and Johor Bahru before making their way to Singapore on the day of the concert.

Malaysian yoga studio manager Awangku Hashrul, 35, will first take the bus from his home in Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru with a friend the day before the concert on March 3. They plan to spend one night there.

The next morning, they will take the Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) train service from Johor to Singapore for the concert, before returning to Johor by train after the show ends. They will stay in Johor Bahru for one more night before returning home to Malaysia’s capital.

“I am trying to save on the costs. Doing it that way is much cheaper. We already spent much on the tickets,” Mr Hashrul told The Straits Times, adding that he bought a concert ticket for about RM2,000 (S$565).

“I am so excited. I think this might be the only chance that I might get to see her performing live. So, it is definitely the tour for me to go to. And I am glad I am going,” he said.

Mr Hashrul said that this way, he gets to spend a total of RM84 on transport, compared with the more than RM540 a round-trip flight ticket from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore would have cost him.

Meanwhile, staying in a hotel in JB for two nights costs him RM357. In Singapore, a two-night hotel stay would set him back more than RM1,000.

He is not the only fan going the extra mile.

Indonesian Tri Surinta, 26, will be travelling by minibus, plane and boat to catch Swift in concert.

1b3pw27,ksttne1,2024-03-01 09:04:23,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Court upholds death penalty, rejects heroin trafficker’s claim he thought it was cannabis  

SINGAPORE – The Court of Appeal has upheld the death sentence imposed on a 33-year-old Singaporean man who was found guilty of heroin trafficking in 2022.

A total of 25 packets of drugs were found in a drawer in Shen Hanjie’s bedroom on Nov 20, 2018, containing 34.94g of pure heroin.

The apex court rejected his claim that he believed the drug bundles contained cannabis because “Alan”, his supplier, had said it was “shao de” – “hot” in Chinese.

He said he understood this term to be the same as “gu”, “grass” or “ganja”, which are terms for cannabis.

Shen, who was represented by Mr Mervyn Cheong had raised this argument in an attempt to rebut the legal presumption that he knew the nature of the drugs in his possession.

In a judgment on March 1, the three-judge court agreed with the trial judge that it was improbable that Alan had lied about the type of drugs involved, as Shen was keeping records of the transactions in his notebooks so that he could account to Alan on the movement of the drugs.

Shen had written down different entries for “hot” and “gu” in the notebooks, which showed he did not think the two terms referred to the same thing, said the court.

The court added that even if Alan had lied about the nature of the drugs, Shen did not say he would have refused to help Alan, if the drugs were heroin instead.

“He was indifferent as to the nature of the drugs being sent to him by Alan, and appeared to be interested in their names only for the purpose of recording all the transactions so that he could give a proper account to Alan when asked,” said the court.

The Court of Appeal also rejected Shen’s argument that he was merely safekeeping the drugs for Alan, and not holding them for the purpose of trafficking.

During his trial, Shen claimed that Alan asked him to keep the drugs for him first, and that within a month, Alan would “ask his man” to take the drugs from him.

This did not support Shen’s defence as it would involve him delivering the drugs to someone other than Alan, said the court.

The court also noted that this was not Shen’s first transaction with Alan. For the previous transactions, Shen admitted that he would deliver the drugs to other people as directed by Alan.

The court found that Shen failed to give an adequate explanation why this transaction was going to be different.

Shen, who was unemployed at the time of his arrest, consumed crystal methamphetamine, or Ice, daily and had a gambling habit.

He stopped helping out at his father’s coffee shop two years prior to his arrest and received allowances from his parents when he needed money.

His financial woes even led him to pawn various items, including some of his parents’ belongings.

Under the law, the death penalty can be imposed for trafficking in more than 15g of heroin.

Here, I'll attempt to explain his job market paper, a crucial piece of work for those aiming to secure an assistant professorship in economics.

Mechanism design investigates how to allocate resources or items between individuals effectively. While it might seem straightforward to rely on free markets for this, in practice, markets often fail to achieve optimal outcomes in terms of seller revenue, social efficiency, or equitable distribution. For example, setting a price for a unique item, like a limited-edition Swatch watch, is challenging without a clear market benchmark. Such items are frequently sold through auctions, a form of mechanism that transfers goods from sellers to buyers. However, mechanisms are not limited to auctions; they also include other forms, like lotteries used in BTO housing allocations. The goal of mechanism design is to create systems that achieve specific objectives, such as maximizing social welfare or seller revenue. This field is complex, as even minor modifications to mechanisms can significantly impact outcomes. For instance, altering auction formats to have winners pay the highest or second-highest bid can make a substantial difference.

For many decades, the prevailing belief in mechanism design was that ""second-price ascending auctions"" and ""second-sealed bid auctions"" were strategically identical (note that in a second price auction, the winner of the auction pays the second-highest bid for the object). Ascending auctions are ""public"", with bids revealed progressively until a winner is declared (e.g., auction where the auctioneer tries to shout ""going once, going twice... sold!""), whereas in sealed-bid auctions, participants submit private bids without knowledge of others' bids (e.g., construction tenders where each contractor has no idea how much his/her rival contractors are bidding for the project). Both formats were considered ""strategy-proof,"" meaning the best strategy for bidders is to bid their true valuation of the item, regardless of others' actions.

However, Shengwu notes that this equivalence is troubling because ""labatory subjects are substantially more likely to play the dominant strategy"" (i.e., bidding your own valuation for the object) under an ascending auction than a sealed-bid auction. So from a behavioural point of view, the evidence doesn't match the theory. He reconciles the two by introducing the concept of ""obviously strategy-proof"" mechanisms, where the benefit of adhering to one's current strategy is at least as good as the worst outcome of deviating. This makes ascending auctions more appealing to bidders with limited cognitive resources, as opposed to sealed-bid auctions, where deviating from the optimal bid can have significant consequences. Intuitively, the sealed-bid auction is  not ""obviously strategy proof"" as the the consequences are locked-in the moment you submit your bid. This stands in contrast to the ascending auction where you are able to ""wait and see"" before quitting.

The entire paper (https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44871788.pdf) is extremely mathematical and I won't go into the details for obvious reasons. However, I would note that Shengwu's formalization of OSP mechanisms has overturned what we have taught to masters and phd (econ) students for generations.",S'porean economist Li Shengwu gets tenure at Harvard University,533,0.94,2024-03-01,No,1838,No,0,"singaporean phd econ student in an ivy league university here. my current research focuses on empirical work, but during my master's and undergraduate studies, i delved into mechanism design, which is also shengwu's area of expertise. here, i'll attempt to explain his job market paper, a crucial piece of work for those aiming to secure an assistant professorship in economics.mechanism design investigates how to allocate resources or items between individuals effectively. while it might seem straightforward to rely on free markets for this, in practice, markets often fail to achieve optimal outcomes in terms of seller revenue, social efficiency, or equitable distribution. for example, setting a price for a unique item, like a limited-edition swatch watch, is challenging without a clear market benchmark. such items are frequently sold through auctions, a form of mechanism that transfers goods from sellers to buyers. however, mechanisms are not limited to auctions; they also include other forms, like lotteries used in bto housing allocations. the goal of mechanism design is to create systems that achieve specific objectives, such as maximizing social welfare or seller revenue. this field is complex, as even minor modifications to mechanisms can significantly impact outcomes. for instance, altering auction formats to have winners pay the highest or second-highest bid can make a substantial difference.for many decades, the prevailing belief in mechanism design was that ""second-price ascending auctions"" and ""second-sealed bid auctions"" were strategically identical (note that in a second price auction, the winner of the auction pays the second-highest bid for the object). ascending auctions are ""public"", with bids revealed progressively until a winner is declared (e.g., auction where the auctioneer tries to shout ""going once, going twice... sold!""), whereas in sealed-bid auctions, participants submit private bids without knowledge of others' bids (e.g., construction tenders where each contractor has no idea how much his/her rival contractors are bidding for the project). both formats were considered ""strategy-proof,"" meaning the best strategy for bidders is to bid their true valuation of the item, regardless of others' actions.however, shengwu notes that this equivalence is troubling because ""labatory subjects are substantially more likely to play the dominant strategy"" (i.e., bidding your own valuation for the object) under an ascending auction than a sealed-bid auction. so from a behavioural point of view, the evidence doesn't match the theory. he reconciles the two by introducing the concept of ""obviously strategy-proof"" mechanisms, where the benefit of adhering to one's current strategy is at least as good as the worst outcome of deviating. this makes ascending auctions more appealing to bidders with limited cognitive resources, as opposed to sealed-bid auctions, where deviating from the optimal bid can have significant consequences. intuitively, the sealed-bid auction is  not ""obviously strategy proof"" as the the consequences are locked-in the moment you submit your bid. this stands in contrast to the ascending auction where you are able to ""wait and see"" before quitting.the entire paper ( is extremely mathematical and i won't go into the details for obvious reasons. however, i would note that shengwu's formalization of osp mechanisms has overturned what we have taught to masters and phd (econ) students for generations.",s'porean economist li shengwu gets tenure at harvard university

""A Vickrey auction or sealed-bid second-price auction (SBSPA) is a type of sealed-bid auction. Bidders submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other people in the auction. The highest bidder wins but the price paid is the second-highest bid.

1b3qows,ksty62s,2024-03-01 10:01:03,SG_wormsbot,"Title: SkillsFuture courses which are not career-related can lead to learning, even 'happiness' outcomes: Experts 

SINGAPORE: Some Singaporeans may choose to use their SkillsFuture credits on courses seemingly irrelevant to careers. But this can still serve other purposes like lifelong learning, plain interest or just general well-being, said HR experts.

“Using the credits on non-career related courses does not take away from the original aim of the scheme,” said Associate Professor Trevor Yu of the Nanyang Technological University’s Nanyang Business School, pointing out that it was to get people started on ""a lifelong journey of constant learning"".

When they turn 25, all Singaporeans are given S$500 (US$371) in SkillsFuture credits that they can use on any registered course.

In his Budget speech in February, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the programme would be expanded – Singaporeans will receive S$4,000 more in credits when they turn 40, but this amount can only be used on selected courses that result in better employment outcomes.

According to the SkillsFuture portal, there are currently over 29,000 courses available for those seeking to use their basic-tier credits.

Among these courses are options which can appear more esoteric or even raise eyebrows, such as when netizens last month ridiculed a S$580 class on toilet cleaning.

But experts urged against taking a ""narrow"" view and dismissing courses as ""frivolous"".

“As it is becoming more common to have two or more different careers across adult working age, what may be non-career related in the present could be a very viable proposition in the future,"" said Assoc Prof Yu.

Whether the knowledge gained from a course is ""useful"" ultimately depends on the individual, said Assistant Professor Aaron Ng from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).

The lecturer in digital communications added that individuals should think more deeply about the trajectories of their careers and lives to make effective use of the SkillsFuture credits.

“The government can help by lowering the barriers to gaining knowledge, but I don't think the government should be micromanaging the individual's future.”

1b3qr5p,kstyi50,2024-03-01 10:05:15,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Revenue collected by SLA from state properties significantly exceeds maintenance cost: MinLaw  

SINGAPORE – The total revenue collected by Singapore Land Authority (SLA) from state properties significantly exceeds the total maintenance cost incurred, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law Rahayu Mahzam.

She was responding on March 1 to Progress Singapore Party (PSP) Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai, who had asked about SLA’s management of state properties, including colonial black and white bungalows.

Mr Leong had sought more information about state properties, including how many of them were vacant and for how long. He noted that the black and white bungalow at 26 Ridout Road was vacant and “in very bad condition” for more than four years before it was rented out.

The rental of state-owned bungalows at 26 and 31 Ridout Road by Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was the subject of a six-hour debate in Parliament in July 2023.

Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong said then that SLA had acted properly in leasing out the properties at 26 and 31 Ridout Road, and that it invests a significant amount in upkeeping and maintaining such properties, owing to conservation requirements and restoration guidelines.

On March 1, Ms Rahayu said the occupancy rate for all usable state properties was 99 per cent in the 2022 financial year.

SLA’s approach was to make basic additions to ensure that the properties are in a reasonably good condition so that tenants are able to reside in them safely, she added during the debate on the budget of the Ministry of Law, under which SLA is a statutory board.

She said SLA will install modern amenities and facilities for selected properties, where the overall circumstances make it advantageous to do so.

On Mr Leong’s point that state properties should not be allowed to “fall into disrepair and be vacant for years”, Ms Rahayu said it would not be the best use of public resources to always renovate properties to a high standard before a tenant is found.

“This is because the condition of the property will deteriorate if there is no take-up, such as in a poor market. Taxpayer money would have to be used again, to redo some works and carry out additional works, when a tenant is found,” she said.

Ms Rahayu added that SLA has carefully broadened the usage and deployment of its properties to meet the evolving needs of Singapore over time, and that a judicious balance continues to be needed between protecting heritage properties in Singapore and redeveloping them.

Mr Leong later pressed Ms Rahayu on the the total rental income and total maintenance cost attributable to the black and white bungalows.

“These are questions that Singaporeans like to know and if enough information is being given, then we can assess better whether we have a big underutilised asset here or not,” he said.

According to Business Times Dec 10, 2023, avg REIT ETFs gave a return of 7.2%. If anything, revenue collected by SLA should beat 7.2% return and not just exceed maintenance cost.

Something like

Revenue return = (Rentals - Maintenance costs) / (State property market land prices + Maintenance costs)

1b3qr5p,ksu8xsq,2024-03-01 12:01:06,TheOnceAndFutureZing,"So there's an interesting push-pull dichotomy with SLA state properties that I've had explained to me. From what I've heard, profit maximisation is often not the only goal when it comes to their rentals.

For example, SLA may want to release more properties for community or charitable uses because these benefit the broader community. Obviously these aren't commercial in nature, so the rental revenue that SLA can collect would be lower than if they just looked for the most profitable uses. It's hard to compare them to purely profit-driven REITs.

Another consideration is to improve Singapore's vibrancy. I think something like Dempsey or Gillman Barracks would not have been possible if they just wanted to maximise profits above all else. 

Also have you seen the SLA state properties? Many of them are like 50+ years old and have very onerous maintenance costs due to conservation requirements etc.

And it's not like they can just sell off non-performing or sub-optimal properties either. They're stuck with them indefinitely (if the properties are conserved) or until there are development plans for the area.",Revenue collected by SLA from state properties significantly exceeds maintenance cost: MinLaw,41,0.89,2024-03-01,No,386,No,0,"so there's an interesting push-pull dichotomy with sla state properties that i've had explained to me. from what i've heard, profit maximisation is often not the only goal when it comes to their rentals.for example, sla may want to release more properties for community or charitable uses because these benefit the broader community. obviously these aren't commercial in nature, so the rental revenue that sla can collect would be lower than if they just looked for the most profitable uses. it's hard to compare them to purely profit-driven reits.another consideration is to improve singapore's vibrancy. i think something like dempsey or gillman barracks would not have been possible if they just wanted to maximise profits above all else. also have you seen the sla state properties? many of them are like 50+ years old and have very onerous maintenance costs due to conservation requirements etc.and it's not like they can just sell off non-performing or sub-optimal properties either. they're stuck with them indefinitely (if the properties are conserved) or until there are development plans for the area.",revenue collected by sla from state properties significantly exceeds maintenance cost: minlaw

There's still quite a difference between not trying to maximise profits and not being concerned with your P&L.

Just because SLA is not purely profit driven doesn't mean that they don't aim to extract good value from their properties. It's just that they have competing interests to consider.

Taylor Swift's upcoming concerts in Singapore have sparked a captivating narrative that transcends the realm of music, weaving together threads of economics, diplomacy, and passionate fandom. While Singapore anticipates a significant financial windfall, neighboring countries in Southeast Asia express a mix of disappointment, frustration, and even hints of regional competition.  


  
At the heart of the controversy lies Singapore's alleged use of financial incentives to secure Swift's exclusive performance, effectively locking out other Southeast Asian nations. This strategy has drawn criticism for its potential to create an uneven playing field and hinder regional collaboration in attracting tourism. Government officials and citizens from Thailand, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of such tactics, questioning if they prioritize short-term economic gain over fostering a spirit of regional cooperation.  


  
While the immediate economic benefits for Singapore are undeniable, with experts predicting a potential $300 million boost from tourism revenue, concerns linger regarding the long-term sustainability of this approach. Economists caution against relying solely on attracting high-profile celebrities as a growth strategy. They advocate for the development of unique attractions, cultural exchange programs, and sustainable tourism practices that foster long-term economic growth and regional collaboration.  


  
Despite the controversy, the allure of seeing Taylor Swift perform is undeniable, as evidenced by fans like 22-year-old Indonesian citizen Audilla Ferialdi. Ferialdi, along with countless others traveling from abroad, is injecting significant sums into Singapore's economy, even though their home countries were not included on the tour schedule. Her story exemplifies the power of celebrity culture to transcend geographical boundaries and generate economic activity, even if it raises questions about equitable distribution of benefits.  


  
This situation lays bare the complex interplay between various forces. The immediate economic benefits for Singapore are substantial, but the long-term implications and ethical considerations surrounding exclusive deals and the over-reliance on celebrity tourism warrant further discussion and potential reevaluation. As the music fades, a crucial conversation about regional collaboration, sustainable economic development, and fostering a spirit of inclusivity in the pursuit of shared prosperity in Southeast Asia takes center stage.",Taylor Swift's Asia Tour Stirs Some Bad Blood,0,0.3,2024-03-01,No,8,No,0,"ai generated summary:&#x200b;&#x200b;taylor swift's upcoming concerts in singapore have sparked a captivating narrative that transcends the realm of music, weaving together threads of economics, diplomacy, and passionate fandom. while singapore anticipates a significant financial windfall, neighboring countries in southeast asia express a mix of disappointment, frustration, and even hints of regional competition.    at the heart of the controversy lies singapore's alleged use of financial incentives to secure swift's exclusive performance, effectively locking out other southeast asian nations. this strategy has drawn criticism for its potential to create an uneven playing field and hinder regional collaboration in attracting tourism. government officials and citizens from thailand, the philippines, and hong kong have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of such tactics, questioning if they prioritize short-term economic gain over fostering a spirit of regional cooperation.    while the immediate economic benefits for singapore are undeniable, with experts predicting a potential $300 million boost from tourism revenue, concerns linger regarding the long-term sustainability of this approach. economists caution against relying solely on attracting high-profile celebrities as a growth strategy. they advocate for the development of unique attractions, cultural exchange programs, and sustainable tourism practices that foster long-term economic growth and regional collaboration.    despite the controversy, the allure of seeing taylor swift perform is undeniable, as evidenced by fans like 22-year-old indonesian citizen audilla ferialdi. ferialdi, along with countless others traveling from abroad, is injecting significant sums into singapore's economy, even though their home countries were not included on the tour schedule. her story exemplifies the power of celebrity culture to transcend geographical boundaries and generate economic activity, even if it raises questions about equitable distribution of benefits.    this situation lays bare the complex interplay between various forces. the immediate economic benefits for singapore are substantial, but the long-term implications and ethical considerations surrounding exclusive deals and the over-reliance on celebrity tourism warrant further discussion and potential reevaluation. as the music fades, a crucial conversation about regional collaboration, sustainable economic development, and fostering a spirit of inclusivity in the pursuit of shared prosperity in southeast asia takes center stage.",taylor swift's asia tour stirs some bad blood

SINGAPORE – Media freelancer Melissa Lee’s biggest wish is to watch American superstar Taylor Swift perform as many times as possible.

So far, she has spent more than $7,000 to attend three concerts of Swift’s The Eras Tour in Sydney, Paris and Singapore – and has no regrets doing so.

Of the sum, $3,000 was for travel costs, concert merchandise and a VIP ticket in Sydney; $4,000 was for travel costs and a VIP ticket in Paris; and $350 was for her Singapore ticket.

The 26-year-old said: “Money can be earned back, but not memories of this concert if I don’t go.

“I don’t know when Taylor Swift will go on tour again, and I was lucky to snag the tickets so I have to go.”

Thousands of Taylor Swift fans, known as Swifties, from South-east Asia will be arriving in Singapore by plane, bus and boat, as the 34-year-old singer-songwriter takes the stage on March 2.

But a number of devoted Singapore Swifties are also following the pop star for her concerts across Australia, Asia and the United States.

Ms Lee, who has been a fan since 2017, said the singer’s surprise song segment is an incentive for her to watch more concerts. During the fan-favourite segment, Swift plays two tracks that have not been played during previous shows.

However, in February, at one of her concerts in Melbourne, the singer announced she would abolish the no-repeat rule for surprise acoustic songs.

1b3tujp,ksugz0z,2024-03-01 13:08:17,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Govt subsidies for Taylor Swift's exclusive Singapore deal 'nowhere as high' as speculated: Edwin Tong 

SINGAPORE: How much did Singapore pay to be the only regional stop for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour?

It is ""nowhere as high"" as reports have suggested, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong told CNA in an interview on Friday (Mar 1).

Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was quoted as saying last month that Singapore had brokered a deal to pay the pop star up to US$3 million for each of her six concerts – in exchange for keeping the shows exclusive to Singapore in Southeast Asia.

CNA understands the figure is closer to US$2 million to US$3 million in total for all six shows.

Mr Srettha said he had heard about the arrangement from concert promoter AEG. The company has not responded to CNA's repeated requests for comment.

On Feb 20, the Singapore Tourism Board said it ""supported the event through a grant"", but did not reveal the size of the grant or any conditions attached to it.

Mr Tong said on Friday that concert promoters know ""exactly what they're doing"" when they choose where to hold shows and where not to.

""What I'll say is this: The numbers that you see online – it is nowhere as high as what is being speculated.""

He added that he will speak more about this in parliament next Monday.

""NOT JUST ABOUT A GRANT""

""With every promoter, they make their own calculations,"" Mr Tong said. ""They decide whether they want to come, how many nights they want to come, where else they want to go.

""The truth of the matter is (it's) not just about a grant or a deal, but the overall package.""

He added that the promoters are experienced and know exactly what they want out of a venue, and there are factors that Singapore cannot control.

""They have to assess whether or not the overall package in Singapore is good enough for them to want to play here, and for how many nights,"" the minister said.

Swift will be playing six sold-out shows in Singapore, her only stop in Asia, aside from Japan. More than 300,000 tickets have been sold, with many fans travelling from other countries to watch the concerts.

SINGAPORE: A Singapore inter-agency task force led by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is looking into legislation to address security and resilience risks faced by key digital infrastructure such as data centres and cloud services.

Speaking in parliament on Friday (Mar 1), Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo said a potential Digital Infrastructure Act (DIA) will focus on areas that can cause a “significant impact” on the economy and society if disrupted.

These include data centres and cloud providers that support the delivery of many widely used services such as banking and payments, ride-hailing, digital identities and social media, said MCI.

The law could require operators to meet higher security and resilience standards to reduce the likelihood of systemic disruptions, said Mrs Teo in a speech where she Iaid out her ministry's spending plans for the year.

Risks that such service providers face could range from misconfigurations in technical architecture to physical hazards such as fires, water leaks and cooling system failures.

Mrs Teo added that the inter-agency task force will continue to consult industry players and relevant stakeholders as it develops its proposals for the DIA.

1b3w78v,ksuwx4k,2024-03-01 14:56:37,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Secondary school students to have one common national exam period from 2027  

SINGAPORE - This year’s Secondary 1 students will be the first to sit their national examinations under one common timetable in 2027.

They will sit the new Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations in 2027 instead of O- and N-level examinations, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on March 1 in Parliament.

This comes after the removal of streaming into Normal and Express in secondary schools in 2024, and the implementation of full subject-based banding, where students take subjects at varying levels according to their strengths and interests.

With the change, students will have one written exam sitting for their mother tongue language (MTL) subject and will not be able to retake the exam, said Mr Chan during the debate on his ministry’s budget.

Currently, students are able to choose from two exam sittings for MTL, one in the middle of the year, usually in the first week of the June holidays, and the other during the O-level written exam period, usually in November.

“I understand that some may be concerned that they will have one less chance to improve their MTL grades,” said Mr Chan.

“But we need to strike a careful balance between striving for excellence, chasing the last mark, and allowing our students to learn at a better pace.”

“When we introduced the mid-year O-level MTL exam sitting in 1980, less than 40 per cent of students passed both their first and second languages,” Mr Chan noted. “So we allowed students to take their MTL exam twice, to meet the second language requirement for pre-university.”

Today, almost all O-level MTL students meet the language requirement with their first sitting, he said, adding that taking the second sitting changed the post-secondary posting outcomes for less than 2 per cent of those taking the MTL exam.

“The new system will allow our students and teachers to better pace the MTL curriculum, with four more months of learning, rather than to squeeze everything into less than 3½ years in preparation for the June sitting,” said Mr Chan.

Students will sit their English and MTL written exams in the second week of September – one month ahead of other subjects to spread out the exam load, he added.

There will also be one common exam period for the written papers of other subjects, starting in October.

Currently, N-level exams are held in September, and O-level exams in October.

Results for the SEC examinations will be released in January the following year.

1b45mta,kswquzn,2024-03-01 21:10:13,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Forum: Naming the pre-schools allegedly involved in child abuse cases could lead to more accountability  

With cases of alleged abuse happening in pre-schools recently reported in the media (Boy, 3, allegedly locked in dark room and shouted at by pre-school teachers; police investigating, Feb 28; and Woman charged with ill-treatment of child at pre-school; she allegedly hit 1-year-old multiple times, Dec 8, 2023), we parents cannot help but wonder if our children are truly safe in pre-schools, as well as what can be done to make the places safer.

In the recent cases, the pre-schools involved were not named on the basis that this could lead to the identification of the alleged victims, which is prohibited under the Children and Young Persons Act.

I think the pre-schools involved should not be allowed to hide their identity under the veil of this Act. Knowing that their reputation would be damaged if they were to be named publicly would make them take more accountability for their actions.

The public would also later be able to judge for themselves if the pre-schools involved have done enough to improve the situation.

And it would serve as a deterrence to other pre-schools and help ensure that their staff conduct themselves appropriately.

1b46kfs,kswxf86,2024-03-01 21:47:46,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Singapore aims to build AI talent pool through accelerated masters programme, visiting professorships 

SINGAPORE: As part of moves to attract and nurture top minds in the area of artificial intelligence (AI), Singapore will launch professorships as well as a masters programme, said Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo on Friday (Mar 1).

The AI Visiting Professorship aims to attract top researchers to collaborate with Singapore, and the plan is to award it to a pilot batch of five visiting professors over the next few years, said the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).

These professors will be required to spend at least 20 per cent of their time on these collaborations. They will also need to identify a local collaborator and will be encouraged to supervise junior researchers and students in Singapore.

“The goal is for these AI visiting professors to drive research aligned with our national AI research agenda, provide increased training opportunities for local students and catalyse additional research activities in Singapore,” said MCI.

This follows Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s announcement during his Budget 2024 speech earlier in February, that the government will invest more than S$1 billion (US$743.7 million) over the next five years in AI computing, talent and industry development.

This supports Singapore’s updated National AI Strategy (NAIS) 2.0, which was launched in December last year.

“There is no doubt that technology has become a big part of Singaporeans' daily lives,” said Mrs Teo in parliament, laying out her ministry's spending plans for the year.

""Overall, 84 per cent say that digital technologies have made their lives easier, and more than half are prepared to try new technologies.""

Tbh it was really good, Norway (or Scandinavian countries in general) just has that happy, can cure depression kind of vibe. I think it's called Hygge. So can explore their cities on walks, go to museums, cafe hopping. In Trømso we also went dog sledding, also got whale watching, fjord tours to see the fjords. Pack heavily, winter is intense, the snow gets to knee length. We stayed in Airbnb and took budget airline flights to the 3 cities we went to, so actually I think I didn't spend up to 7k, it was more like 3/4k for me. We cooked most days, ate out for a couple of meals for each city. That's how we kept to budget. (And maybe also cos my flight tix was UK-Norway but hers is Singapore-UK-Norway) 

>Though they mentioned $7k budget, that was my expense for Japan last year so I think this one is probably even higher?

It could be, inflation this year now would suck :(

1b4biez,ksxtr25,2024-03-02 01:13:47,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Dignity Kitchen hopes to raise $200,000 for restoration works after fire  

SINGAPORE – Social enterprise Dignity Kitchen is hoping to raise $200,000 for restoration works after a fire damaged its premises on Feb 13. It has received over $23,000 from more than 200 people on crowdfunding platform Give Asia so far.

The organisation’s 10,600 sq ft premises at 69 Boon Keng Road were damaged after a fire in the rubbish collection centre next to its building spread, destroying its wall, roof, electrical items and air-conditioning units.

The incident, which occurred in the wee hours of the morning, has been classified as “mischief by fire” and police investigations are ongoing.

Founder Koh Seng Choon, 65, told The Straits Times he was away in Hong Kong, where he has another Dignity Kitchen branch, when the incident happened. He returned to Singapore on Feb 28.

Dignity Kitchen is run by Project Dignity, a social enterprise founded in 2010 to create jobs for people with disabilities. Its Singapore branch comprises a full-functioning hawker centre open to the public, a culinary training centre, social outreach programmes, and secondhand book stalls.

Mr Koh told The Straits Times the training centre suffered the main damage. The quotation he received for repairing the exterior walls, as well as replacing the air-conditioning units and roof, amounted to about $130,000. However, the full extent of the damage cannot be assessed until the roof is removed. It will also take some time for his insurer to determine and process the payout.

Training makes up 30 to 40 per cent of Project Dignity’s total business revenue, he said. Dignity Learn, its inclusive training programme, provides Workforce Skills Qualification- and SkillsFuture-eligible hawker culinary courses for the public. It also runs a 22-day Train-and-Place programme for adults with special needs seeking employment.

Mr Koh said he has asked for urgent rewiring works and bought a portable air-conditioner to resume training classes, but lessons will have to stop again for about 12 weeks when restoration works are carried out. He added that he could not yet determine the total amount of revenue loss.

The food court, which has seven stalls manned by the differently abled and disadvantaged, resumed operations on Feb 19. Its operations include providing free box meals to 90 low-wage workers for dinner from Mondays to Fridays.

“We lost business at our food court for several days, including over Valentine’s Day and part of Chinese New Year,” Mr Koh said. “Business is picking up again now.”

“We have been through a lot of crises but we are still growing. One good thing that came out of this is that my team of over 100 staff handled the crisis well while I was away.”

Entrepreneur Vivian Pan, 39, donated $100 to Dignity Kitchen’s fund-raiser.

“Mr Koh is a humble man and good leader,” she said. “He doesn’t give up and keeps fighting for his dream.”

Director fees ? (For a non-profit / social enterprise ??. I myself a director in a non-profit and there are tons of people who want to be on board).. Manpower costs are taking a significant chunk. While I don't expect people to work free (in fact they should get a bit more) a bit taken by the % . If we look in to the details, 

* Gross profit is pretty good (from 27% in FY2019 to 37% in FY20 to 41% in FY21)
* Other op expenses went (from 54% in FY2019 to 75% in FY20 to 69% in FY21) and these are essentially staff costs
   *  based on Google, 120x employees (70 in SG, 50 in HK) and the expenses were closed to a mil which is \~ 8K per employee and very reasonable
   * Foreigner levy etc increased 2020 vs 2021 means employed foreigners post covid (much needed in F&B)
   * Director fee of 100K (I may be wrong but is it to the Board / CEO pay?) if it's the CEO, that's pretty ok and nobody can work for free. For directors - then I do mind :)

1b4cvlw,ksy336x,2024-03-02 02:17:40,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Commentary: Uproar over lantern festival and drone show cancellations highlight importance of good PR 

NOTHING TO SAY OR SOMETHING TO HIDE?

Ronan Keating once famously sang, “You say it best when you say nothing at all.” While the song was about how the protagonist’s gestures communicate better than words, there is also a more cynical interpretation that people tend to assume that one has something to hide. And once that is seeded into a mob mentality, it tends to stick.

In the past, when a press statement cites “unforeseen circumstances”, the public was largely dependent on the skill of the journalist to fully report what happened. If the public wasn’t satisfied by news reports, their questions were often only heard in their circles or coffee shops.

Today, the public’s questions are in full view, and these unanswered questions serve to create opinions about organisations.

Questions such as, why didn’t the event organiser for the sky lantern festival get all the necessary permits before marketing the event? How was getting necessary permits ahead of time “unforeseen”?

Why didn’t the event organiser, after conducting their failed trials, not inform ticket holders immediately that the event might not go ahead as planned and offer the option for refunds?

All these questions, when not answered, will result in the public forming the opinion that the event organiser cannot be trusted, which will then impact their ability to market more events in the future.

The impact is not limited to just the event organiser. Sentosa, for example, stated that the event was organised by a third party, for which it was the venue provider.

But questions could be asked by the public as to how Sentosa selects events for their premises. Those questions are raised because Sentosa is no ordinary venue provider, it is a national icon and a shining beacon of Singapore’s attractiveness as a tourist destination.

To protect that reputation, could Sentosa have shared why they agreed to rent the venue out to the organiser and perhaps build a narrative of their due diligence process?
