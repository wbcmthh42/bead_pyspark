1b3mech,ksxv2gf,2024-03-02 01:22:41,Kyokonizu,"Singapore is definitely feeling the crunch and at this pace, we are moving towards those of Japan and S. Korea which is bad.

In my opinion, like many others here, the main reasons why people do not want kids is because of the expected costs associated with kids. 

Being a parent, you always want to give the best you can for your kids. If not, you might feel that you have not provided enough (or at least give your kid the best chance) to win in life in the future. That‚Äôs a really scary thought isn‚Äôt it, if everyone else have this and that, but if you never provide for ‚Äòthis and that‚Äô then ultimately your kids lose out and the future may not be as bright. 

Costs in Singapore is rising so much, even hawker centre prices are going up (albeit slowly), housing is getting more expensive because of the fact there‚Äôs no control on developers pushing prices up (buy, rebuilt, resell: their biz model, that‚Äôs why your houses getting smaller. Divide more can sell more) so surrounding area housing prices also will shoot up. 

If housing is expensive, how are the citizens encouraged to get a place that is ‚Äúfit‚Äù to have children? Need at least 4RM which is costly. And there is no policy to help these families bridge into a bigger place (need to sell to down pay for the new house) so this is definitely a big consideration. Gov should step in and make this transition (either through grants, priority, gov int free loan are some suggestions) 

There‚Äôs also the expectation of time commitment to care for the kid. Working culture in Asia suck, there is little to no work life balance. We are all at the mercy of our employers. Because as a society, we are chasing GDP at the expense of our citizens.  We don‚Äôt even have much time to ourselves, how to have time for kids? OT culture is expected too, becomes the norm and then people turn into workaholics out of fear. 

This needs to change, some sacrifice of GDP may be necessary. This is top down from gov policy (just see what Australia did with the passing of law where employer cannot contact employees after a certain time). This stronghold maybe the necessary evil to provide a better work-life balance, with this, people may start to see life isn‚Äôt that bad and then want to have kids. Anyway, you can also increase GDP with a higher fertility rate, cause with more people, they spend more :) 

With a lot of foreigners coming into our little red dot also begets the question of why the need for those coming in as fresh grads? I understand we need foreign talents with experience but those at the start of their careers shouldn‚Äôt qualify as talent. This competition also makes people feel like their future kids have a lot of competition even for jobs. Like I have a couple of foreigner friends that started their careers in SG, did not serve NS. After a couple of years either become PR or Citizen. Mind you, they are way ahead in terms of careers than most of us that did NS. And‚Ä¶best, they don‚Äôt need to do reservice‚Ä¶so why do our kids have to suffer for these people? An idea is to make these newly minted PR, citizen compulsory to serve in volunteer core. If S.korea can delay and make citizen serve at 28-30, why not these people too? 


Another reason is the lack of convenience due to rising costs like vehicles. COE is so bloody expensive, and that‚Äôs actually a need for most couples with children. Going to the hospital, going to school etc need a car for sure. Encouraging people to have kids must also provide for the infrastructure behind this. What gov can do to encourage people to have kids is to allocate a portion of the COE to parents with kids (1-9 years old). These are the people who need it most, not the rich ones that have 6x - 9x cars sitting at home doing jack shit.

Actually, even if by magic, from next year all child-related costs (from when baby come out until age 16 when baby has grown up and can make babies) ends up being heavily subsidized by government, it will have exactly zero impact on people in SG (from age 16-40) in whether they will want to have babies.

The mentality of entire generations having less internal desire to need/want to  get married/have babies/start family started when the working economy changed from a single-income household to dual-income household.

In a small country like SG, it is possible (I think) to institute advanced social engineering method(s) to psychologically manipulate people from a young age (basically when they start going to school), so that when they grow up, they have the desire to get married and start a family.

1b3mech,kt3pbvf,2024-03-03 03:59:08,anakinmcfly,"> Did guys have a choice when they go ns? 

No, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? Your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. It's not a solution. It just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. Just make girls do NS too and solve everything.

> What if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?

Some of those are covered by the PES system. There can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. Likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. It also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.

> Many not suited for parents? But many still are

This also depends a lot on who their partner is. Raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. That will mean a Singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.

It *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. Do you really believe that every single guy in Singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes NS? And if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?

NS lasts two years plus reservist. It's most similar to a manual labour job. It is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.

I feel sorry for your wife and kids. (at least, I assume you're married with kids, since from your profile you're 24 years old, and you think it just takes 2 years to find a partner and marry them. You've had 4 years since your NS ended.)","Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice",265,0.95,2024-03-03,no,1026,No,0,"> did guys have a choice when they go ns? no, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. it's not a solution. it just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. just make girls do ns too and solve everything.> what if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?some of those are covered by the pes system. there can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. it also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.> many not suited for parents? but many still arethis also depends a lot on who their partner is. raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. that will mean a singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.it *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. do you really believe that every single guy in singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes ns? and if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?ns lasts two years plus reservist. it's most similar to a manual labour job. it is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.i feel sorry for your wife and kids.

JAKARTA ‚Äì Thousands of Taylor Swift fans from South-east Asia will be converging on Singapore by plane, bus and even boat, as the singer‚Äôs Eras Tour approaches this weekend, beginning on March 2.

With a total of more than 300,000 tickets sold for six concerts at the National Stadium, overseas fans have already snapped up plane tickets and hotel accommodation in Singapore.

But others are taking more unconventional routes.

To save on transport and accommodation, some Swifties ‚Äì as the American singer-songwriter‚Äôs fans are called ‚Äì will be staying in nearby Batam and Johor Bahru before making their way to Singapore on the day of the concert.

Malaysian yoga studio manager Awangku Hashrul, 35, will first take the bus from his home in Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru with a friend the day before the concert on March 3. They plan to spend one night there.

The next morning, they will take the Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) train service from Johor to Singapore for the concert, before returning to Johor by train after the show ends. They will stay in Johor Bahru for one more night before returning home to Malaysia‚Äôs capital.

‚ÄúI am trying to save on the costs. Doing it that way is much cheaper. We already spent much on the tickets,‚Äù Mr Hashrul told The Straits Times, adding that he bought a concert ticket for about RM2,000 (S$565).

‚ÄúI am so excited. I think this might be the only chance that I might get to see her performing live. So, it is definitely the tour for me to go to. And I am glad I am going,‚Äù he said.

Mr Hashrul said that this way, he gets to spend a total of RM84 on transport, compared with the more than RM540 a round-trip flight ticket from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore would have cost him.

Meanwhile, staying in a hotel in JB for two nights costs him RM357. In Singapore, a two-night hotel stay would set him back more than RM1,000.

He is not the only fan going the extra mile.

Indonesian Tri Surinta, 26, will be travelling by minibus, plane and boat to catch Swift in concert.

For example, SLA may want to release more properties for community or charitable uses because these benefit the broader community. Obviously these aren't commercial in nature, so the rental revenue that SLA can collect would be lower than if they just looked for the most profitable uses. It's hard to compare them to purely profit-driven REITs.

Another consideration is to improve Singapore's vibrancy. I think something like Dempsey or Gillman Barracks would not have been possible if they just wanted to maximise profits above all else. 

Also have you seen the SLA state properties? Many of them are like 50+ years old and have very onerous maintenance costs due to conservation requirements etc.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Media freelancer Melissa Lee‚Äôs biggest wish is to watch American superstar Taylor Swift perform as many times as possible.

So far, she has spent more than $7,000 to attend three concerts of Swift‚Äôs The Eras Tour in Sydney, Paris and Singapore ‚Äì and has no regrets doing so.

Of the sum, $3,000 was for travel costs, concert merchandise and a VIP ticket in Sydney; $4,000 was for travel costs and a VIP ticket in Paris; and $350 was for her Singapore ticket.

The 26-year-old said: ‚ÄúMoney can be earned back, but not memories of this concert if I don‚Äôt go.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when Taylor Swift will go on tour again, and I was lucky to snag the tickets so I have to go.‚Äù

Thousands of Taylor Swift fans, known as Swifties, from South-east Asia will be arriving in Singapore by plane, bus and boat, as the 34-year-old singer-songwriter takes the stage on March 2.

But a number of devoted Singapore Swifties are also following the pop star for her concerts across Australia, Asia and the United States.

Ms Lee, who has been a fan since 2017, said the singer‚Äôs surprise song segment is an incentive for her to watch more concerts. During the fan-favourite segment, Swift plays two tracks that have not been played during previous shows.

However, in February, at one of her concerts in Melbourne, the singer announced she would abolish the no-repeat rule for surprise acoustic songs.

1b3w78v,ksuwx4k,2024-03-01 14:56:37,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Secondary school students to have one common national exam period from 2027  

SINGAPORE - This year‚Äôs Secondary 1 students will be the first to sit their national examinations under one common timetable in 2027.

They will sit the new Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations in 2027 instead of O- and N-level examinations, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on March 1 in Parliament.

This comes after the removal of streaming into Normal and Express in secondary schools in 2024, and the implementation of full subject-based banding, where students take subjects at varying levels according to their strengths and interests.

With the change, students will have one written exam sitting for their mother tongue language (MTL) subject and will not be able to retake the exam, said Mr Chan during the debate on his ministry‚Äôs budget.

Currently, students are able to choose from two exam sittings for MTL, one in the middle of the year, usually in the first week of the June holidays, and the other during the O-level written exam period, usually in November.

‚ÄúI understand that some may be concerned that they will have one less chance to improve their MTL grades,‚Äù said Mr Chan.

‚ÄúBut we need to strike a careful balance between striving for excellence, chasing the last mark, and allowing our students to learn at a better pace.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we introduced the mid-year O-level MTL exam sitting in 1980, less than 40 per cent of students passed both their first and second languages,‚Äù Mr Chan noted. ‚ÄúSo we allowed students to take their MTL exam twice, to meet the second language requirement for pre-university.‚Äù

Today, almost all O-level MTL students meet the language requirement with their first sitting, he said, adding that taking the second sitting changed the post-secondary posting outcomes for less than 2 per cent of those taking the MTL exam.

‚ÄúThe new system will allow our students and teachers to better pace the MTL curriculum, with four more months of learning, rather than to squeeze everything into less than 3¬Ω years in preparation for the June sitting,‚Äù said Mr Chan.

Students will sit their English and MTL written exams in the second week of September ‚Äì one month ahead of other subjects to spread out the exam load, he added.

There will also be one common exam period for the written papers of other subjects, starting in October.

Currently, N-level exams are held in September, and O-level exams in October.

Results for the SEC examinations will be released in January the following year.

1b45mta,kswquzn,2024-03-01 21:10:13,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Forum: Naming the pre-schools allegedly involved in child abuse cases could lead to more accountability  

With cases of alleged abuse happening in pre-schools recently reported in the media (Boy, 3, allegedly locked in dark room and shouted at by pre-school teachers; police investigating, Feb 28; and Woman charged with ill-treatment of child at pre-school; she allegedly hit 1-year-old multiple times, Dec 8, 2023), we parents cannot help but wonder if our children are truly safe in pre-schools, as well as what can be done to make the places safer.

In the recent cases, the pre-schools involved were not named on the basis that this could lead to the identification of the alleged victims, which is prohibited under the Children and Young Persons Act.

I think the pre-schools involved should not be allowed to hide their identity under the veil of this Act. Knowing that their reputation would be damaged if they were to be named publicly would make them take more accountability for their actions.

The public would also later be able to judge for themselves if the pre-schools involved have done enough to improve the situation.

And it would serve as a deterrence to other pre-schools and help ensure that their staff conduct themselves appropriately.

A Malaysian worker can live in Malaysia, go to Singapore for work and return home for dinner and be with your family. No need to live and rent in SG. You make SGD but spend in MYR. A dream scenario for many Malaysians.

HSR is a giant talent vacuum cleaner for Singapore that spread catchment a lot further into Peninsula Malaysia that further accelerates the brain drain.

Singapore benefits from the talent, they pay social security and taxes in SG, but because Malaysians return home, the Malaysian state bears the costs of housing, security, medical, education.

Malaysia probably hope for greater SG tourism and more property and business investment. There may be a bump but it may not sufficiently mitigate the huge loss of talent and revenue.
