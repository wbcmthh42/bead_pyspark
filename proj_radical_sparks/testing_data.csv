1b8vwf4,kuukpdh,2024-03-14 23:41:27,nicjude,">I think if you look at feminists movements, they do not blame or rally upon men. The problem according to conventional feminist is the patriarchal system. This system harms both men and women. So women support women to deal with harmful patriarchal roles, not to put down men.

Except that feminist movements constantly blame a lot of issues on the patriarchy, in essence the blame is levelled solely on men. It's true that feminism harms both sexes, but not equally; it continues to disadvantage men a lot more than women. And having come out on top in the culture wars in the last few years, feminism has made it a point to ensure that men would not find a safe space in society. 

If I'm being realistic, the hotline for men might not work as well or as effectively as one should anticipate as yet, especially considering not many know of it especially those that would need it but have nowhere to turn. It would help to get the word out, and not be accused of being a misogynistic venture hopefully.",48% of S’poreans believe promoting women’s equality has become discrimination against men: Ipsos study,Singapore,1237.0,0.92,2024-03-14,no,950,No,0,">i think if you look at feminists movements, they do not blame or rally upon men. the problem according to conventional feminist is the patriarchal system. this system harms both men and women. so women support women to deal with harmful patriarchal roles, not to put down men.except that feminist movements constantly blame a lot of issues on the patriarchy, in essence the blame is levelled solely on men. it's true that feminism harms both sexes, but not equally; it continues to disadvantage men a lot more than women. and having come out on top in the culture wars in the last few years, feminism has made it a point to ensure that men would not find a safe space in society. if i'm being realistic, the hotline for men might not work as well or as effectively as one should anticipate as yet, especially considering not many know of it especially those that would need it but have nowhere to turn. it would help to get the word out, and not be accused of being a misogynistic venture hopefully.",48% of s’poreans believe promoting women’s equality has become discrimination against men: ipsos study

1bczcs6,kuj2rsa,2024-03-12 23:02:24,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Hiring outlook in Singapore weakens for 2nd quarter in a row: Survey  

SINGAPORE – Hiring sentiments in Singapore declined for a second consecutive quarter, driven by a sharp rise in employer pessimism in communication services, which include telecommunications and the media.

However, improved net employment outlooks in the finance and real estate sector, as well as the energy and utilities sector, helped cushion the drop, according to the latest results from recruitment firm ManpowerGroup’s quarterly employment outlook survey released on March 12.

Net employment outlook is a measure of hiring optimism, defined as the percentage of companies surveyed that intend to take on new staff, minus the percentage that intend to downsize.

Employers in the communication services sector reported a net employment outlook of negative 29 per cent, which means more firms polled from the sector intend to downsize than expand their headcount.

It is the only one of the nine sectors surveyed with a negative outlook in the latest results. The figure is down 72 percentage points from the previous quarter and 88 percentage points from the same time in 2023.

ManpowerGroup’s January poll of 525 employers in nine sectors on their hiring plans in the quarter ahead – the second quarter of 2024 – found net employment outlook to be 24 per cent overall. The survey also polled 41 other markets.

The 24 per cent is down 5 percentage points from the previous quarter’s net employment outlook, which was itself 7 percentage points lower compared with the quarter before that. The latest figure is also a drop of 3 percentage points from that of the same period in 2023.

For the second quarter of 2024, 41 per cent of employers polled expected headcount to grow, 17 per cent anticipated a decrease and 42 per cent reported no plans to change their headcount.

The proportion of those which expected a decrease in headcount is higher than the 15 per cent in the previous quarter.

Employers in finance and real estate were the most optimistic, with net employment outlook at 45 per cent.

Also anticipating healthy headcount growth are the employers in healthcare and life sciences, which posted a net employment outlook of 36 per cent, and those in energy and utilities, at 33 per cent, the firm noted.

Hiring sentiment improved the most in the energy and utilities sector compared with the previous quarter, growing by 22 percentage points, the firm added.

“Banking and finance companies are seeing a boom in demand for sustainable financing as more businesses take on sustainable loans to support their green transformation,” said Ms Linda Teo, country manager of ManpowerGroup Singapore.

“With Singapore being a leading hub for green finance and carbon trading in Asia and globally, banking and finance companies are actively recruiting talent with environmental, social and corporate governance expertise and qualifications to support their growth in this area.”

I’m not sure what you consider a “teacher” in your responses but my cousin is a public school teacher and is making in the ballpark of 85k not including bonuses, has under ten years of experience, and drives a nice car.

1beetap,kusu1lv,2024-03-14 14:37:28,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Malaysia’s anti-graft agency turns up the heat on Singaporean businessman over decades-old multi-million dollar transactions 

KUALA LUMPUR: Singaporean businessman and prominent Malaysia property developer Akbar Khan is under investigation on allegations of money laundering and corruption by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).

MACC investigators temporarily detained Mr Akbar, who is the main shareholder of high-end developer BRDB Developments Sdn Bhd, for questioning last week after raiding his home and business premise in the capital Kuala Lumpur, senior sources from the agency and lawyers familiar with the situation told CNA.

Apart from freezing the business and personal accounts of the businessman, the MACC also ordered Mr Akbar to declare his assets and the financial holdings of his family, the sources added.

The 83-year-old Mr Akbar declined to comment on the MACC probe when contacted by CNA.

“As this is an ongoing matter, we refrain from commenting on specific details. Our primary focus remains on ensuring a fair investigation,” noted a spokesperson in Mr Akbar’s office.

MACC sources said the businessman is expected to be recalled by the agency for more questioning in the coming days together with other former close associates.

They played crucial roles in the repatriation of frozen shares valued at US$4 billion that were once listed in Singapore’s now-defunct over-the-counter market that traded mainly in Malaysian shares called Central Limit Order Book, or CLOB, and a controversial transaction involving the change of shareholding at conglomerate Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd (MPHB) in the late 1990s and 2000.

Mr Akbar is the latest in a growing cast of business personalities who have been ensnared in the MACC’s widening investigation on former finance minister Daim Zainuddin.

1bencjd,kuun129,2024-03-14 23:54:21,Liwesh,"So, according to one of your previous post, you mentioned that you got laid off sometime last year in 2023.

In the same post, you also mentioned that 

>Problem is I now have a girlfriend who's local, we're not willing to do long distance and not been together long enough to consider marriage

8 months later (2 months ago), you posted about proposing

I assume that between then and now, you have proposed, and your gf accepted, because around the same time, you posted about applying for PMLA.

What changed in the short span of 8 months that changed you and your gf's mind to consider marriage?

Not to mention that in one of your comments recently (3 hours ago), you basically haven't gotten a job since last being laid off last year.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1b1v2hd/comment/kutqmon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1b1v2hd/comment/kutqmon/)

So while being unemployed for about 10 months, you and your gf go from ""not being together long enough to consider marriage"" to ""being engaged and applying for PMLA""?

And you wonder why your PMLA got rejected? 

>we did the PMLA together and got rejected to my surprise.

From the government's pov, why would they consider giving PMLA to a foreigner who isn't working and contributing to Singapore's society. Put it this way, if a proposal/engagement was all that was necessary for a PMLA, any foreigner can propose or be proposed to, get one foot into Singapore, then apply for LTVP before finally applying for PR, all while not contributing to Singapore's economy.

And to top it all off, 

>Should I just call the wedding off and end the relationship?

Personally to me, this coupled with your previous posts about going from not considering marriage to proposing in the span of 8 months, could be an indicator that your issue is more about getting a job (here in Singapore), rather than settling down with your gf. 

Which I frankly feel, is actually not wrong. You SHOULD be thinking about your finances before even considering marriage. Is your gf/future wife suppose to support you while you continue looking for a job?

My personal opinion, to ""Should I just call the wedding off and end the relationship?"". Yeah. Maybe seriously consider that, both for your and her sake. Because it seems like your priority is not the relationship. And I would agree if that's the case. Maybe focus on your career first, else your future wife has to work doubly hard to support herself and you.",PMLA rejected ,askSingapore,0.0,0.38,2024-03-14,no,1913,No,0,"so, according to one of your previous post, you mentioned that you got laid off sometime last year in 2023.[in the same post, you also mentioned that >problem is i now have a girlfriend who's local, we're not willing to do long distance and not been together long enough to consider marriage8 months later (2 months ago), you posted about proposing[i assume that between then and now, you have proposed, and your gf accepted, because around the same time, you posted about applying for pmla.[what changed in the short span of 8 months that changed you and your gf's mind to consider marriage?not to mention that in one of your comments recently (3 hours ago), you basically haven't gotten a job since last being laid off last year.[so while being unemployed for about 10 months, you and your gf go from ""not being together long enough to consider marriage"" to ""being engaged and applying for pmla""?and you wonder why your pmla got rejected? >we did the pmla together and got rejected to my surprise.from the government's pov, why would they consider giving pmla to a foreigner who isn't working and contributing to singapore's society. put it this way, if a proposal/engagement was all that was necessary for a pmla, any foreigner can propose or be proposed to, get one foot into singapore, then apply for ltvp before finally applying for pr, all while not contributing to singapore's economy.and to top it all off, >should i just call the wedding off and end the relationship?personally to me, this coupled with your previous posts about going from not considering marriage to proposing in the span of 8 months, could be an indicator that your issue is more about getting a job (here in singapore), rather than settling down with your gf. which i frankly feel, is actually not wrong. you should be thinking about your finances before even considering marriage. is your gf/future wife suppose to support you while you continue looking for a job?my personal opinion, to ""should i just call the wedding off and end the relationship?"". yeah. maybe seriously consider that, both for your and her sake. because it seems like your priority is not the relationship. and i would agree if that's the case. maybe focus on your career first, else your future wife has to work doubly hard to support herself and you.",pmla rejected
