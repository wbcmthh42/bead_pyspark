1b3mech,ksxv2gf,2024-03-02 01:22:41,Kyokonizu,"Singapore is definitely feeling the crunch and at this pace, we are moving towards those of Japan and S. Korea which is bad.

In my opinion, like many others here, the main reasons why people do not want kids is because of the expected costs associated with kids. 

Being a parent, you always want to give the best you can for your kids. If not, you might feel that you have not provided enough (or at least give your kid the best chance) to win in life in the future. That‚Äôs a really scary thought isn‚Äôt it, if everyone else have this and that, but if you never provide for ‚Äòthis and that‚Äô then ultimately your kids lose out and the future may not be as bright. 

Costs in Singapore is rising so much, even hawker centre prices are going up (albeit slowly), housing is getting more expensive because of the fact there‚Äôs no control on developers pushing prices up (buy, rebuilt, resell: their biz model, that‚Äôs why your houses getting smaller. Divide more can sell more) so surrounding area housing prices also will shoot up. 

If housing is expensive, how are the citizens encouraged to get a place that is ‚Äúfit‚Äù to have children? Need at least 4RM which is costly. And there is no policy to help these families bridge into a bigger place (need to sell to down pay for the new house) so this is definitely a big consideration. Gov should step in and make this transition (either through grants, priority, gov int free loan are some suggestions) 

There‚Äôs also the expectation of time commitment to care for the kid. Working culture in Asia suck, there is little to no work life balance. We are all at the mercy of our employers. Because as a society, we are chasing GDP at the expense of our citizens.  We don‚Äôt even have much time to ourselves, how to have time for kids? OT culture is expected too, becomes the norm and then people turn into workaholics out of fear. 

This needs to change, some sacrifice of GDP may be necessary. This is top down from gov policy (just see what Australia did with the passing of law where employer cannot contact employees after a certain time). This stronghold maybe the necessary evil to provide a better work-life balance, with this, people may start to see life isn‚Äôt that bad and then want to have kids. Anyway, you can also increase GDP with a higher fertility rate, cause with more people, they spend more :) 

With a lot of foreigners coming into our little red dot also begets the question of why the need for those coming in as fresh grads? I understand we need foreign talents with experience but those at the start of their careers shouldn‚Äôt qualify as talent. This competition also makes people feel like their future kids have a lot of competition even for jobs. Like I have a couple of foreigner friends that started their careers in SG, did not serve NS. After a couple of years either become PR or Citizen. Mind you, they are way ahead in terms of careers than most of us that did NS. And‚Ä¶best, they don‚Äôt need to do reservice‚Ä¶so why do our kids have to suffer for these people? An idea is to make these newly minted PR, citizen compulsory to serve in volunteer core. If S.korea can delay and make citizen serve at 28-30, why not these people too? 


Another reason is the lack of convenience due to rising costs like vehicles. COE is so bloody expensive, and that‚Äôs actually a need for most couples with children. Going to the hospital, going to school etc need a car for sure. Encouraging people to have kids must also provide for the infrastructure behind this. What gov can do to encourage people to have kids is to allocate a portion of the COE to parents with kids (1-9 years old). These are the people who need it most, not the rich ones that have 6x - 9x cars sitting at home doing jack shit.

Actually, even if by magic, from next year all child-related costs (from when baby come out until age 16 when baby has grown up and can make babies) ends up being heavily subsidized by government, it will have exactly zero impact on people in SG (from age 16-40) in whether they will want to have babies.

1b3mech,kt3pbvf,2024-03-03 03:59:08,anakinmcfly,"> Did guys have a choice when they go ns? 

No, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? Your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. It's not a solution. It just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. Just make girls do NS too and solve everything.

> What if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?

Some of those are covered by the PES system. There can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. Likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. It also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.

> Many not suited for parents? But many still are

This also depends a lot on who their partner is. Raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. That will mean a Singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.

It *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. Do you really believe that every single guy in Singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes NS? And if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?

NS lasts two years plus reservist. It's most similar to a manual labour job. It is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.

I feel sorry for your wife and kids. (at least, I assume you're married with kids, since from your profile you're 24 years old, and you think it just takes 2 years to find a partner and marry them. You've had 4 years since your NS ended.)","Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice",singapore,266,0.95,2024-03-03,no,1027,No,0,"> did guys have a choice when they go ns? no, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. it's not a solution. it just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. just make girls do ns too and solve everything.> what if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?some of those are covered by the pes system. there can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. it also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.> many not suited for parents? but many still arethis also depends a lot on who their partner is. raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. that will mean a singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.it *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. do you really believe that every single guy in singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes ns? and if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?ns lasts two years plus reservist. it's most similar to a manual labour job. it is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.i feel sorry for your wife and kids.

For example, SLA may want to release more properties for community or charitable uses because these benefit the broader community. Obviously these aren't commercial in nature, so the rental revenue that SLA can collect would be lower than if they just looked for the most profitable uses. It's hard to compare them to purely profit-driven REITs.

Another consideration is to improve Singapore's vibrancy. I think something like Dempsey or Gillman Barracks would not have been possible if they just wanted to maximise profits above all else. 

Also have you seen the SLA state properties? Many of them are like 50+ years old and have very onerous maintenance costs due to conservation requirements etc.

And it's not like they can just sell off non-performing or sub-optimal properties either.

&#x200B;

Taylor Swift's upcoming concerts in Singapore have sparked a captivating narrative that transcends the realm of music, weaving together threads of economics, diplomacy, and passionate fandom. While Singapore anticipates a significant financial windfall, neighboring countries in Southeast Asia express a mix of disappointment, frustration, and even hints of regional competition.  


  
At the heart of the controversy lies Singapore's alleged use of financial incentives to secure Swift's exclusive performance, effectively locking out other Southeast Asian nations. This strategy has drawn criticism for its potential to create an uneven playing field and hinder regional collaboration in attracting tourism. Government officials and citizens from Thailand, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of such tactics, questioning if they prioritize short-term economic gain over fostering a spirit of regional cooperation.  


  
While the immediate economic benefits for Singapore are undeniable, with experts predicting a potential $300 million boost from tourism revenue, concerns linger regarding the long-term sustainability of this approach. Economists caution against relying solely on attracting high-profile celebrities as a growth strategy. They advocate for the development of unique attractions, cultural exchange programs, and sustainable tourism practices that foster long-term economic growth and regional collaboration.  


  
Despite the controversy, the allure of seeing Taylor Swift perform is undeniable, as evidenced by fans like 22-year-old Indonesian citizen Audilla Ferialdi. Ferialdi, along with countless others traveling from abroad, is injecting significant sums into Singapore's economy, even though their home countries were not included on the tour schedule. Her story exemplifies the power of celebrity culture to transcend geographical boundaries and generate economic activity, even if it raises questions about equitable distribution of benefits.  


  
This situation lays bare the complex interplay between various forces. The immediate economic benefits for Singapore are substantial, but the long-term implications and ethical considerations surrounding exclusive deals and the over-reliance on celebrity tourism warrant further discussion and potential reevaluation. As the music fades, a crucial conversation about regional collaboration, sustainable economic development, and fostering a spirit of inclusivity in the pursuit of shared prosperity in Southeast Asia takes center stage.",Taylor Swift's Asia Tour Stirs Some Bad Blood,singapore,0,0.3,2024-03-01,no,8,No,0,"ai generated summary:&#x200b;&#x200b;taylor swift's upcoming concerts in singapore have sparked a captivating narrative that transcends the realm of music, weaving together threads of economics, diplomacy, and passionate fandom. while singapore anticipates a significant financial windfall, neighboring countries in southeast asia express a mix of disappointment, frustration, and even hints of regional competition.    at the heart of the controversy lies singapore's alleged use of financial incentives to secure swift's exclusive performance, effectively locking out other southeast asian nations. this strategy has drawn criticism for its potential to create an uneven playing field and hinder regional collaboration in attracting tourism. government officials and citizens from thailand, the philippines, and hong kong have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of such tactics, questioning if they prioritize short-term economic gain over fostering a spirit of regional cooperation.    while the immediate economic benefits for singapore are undeniable, with experts predicting a potential $300 million boost from tourism revenue, concerns linger regarding the long-term sustainability of this approach. economists caution against relying solely on attracting high-profile celebrities as a growth strategy. they advocate for the development of unique attractions, cultural exchange programs, and sustainable tourism practices that foster long-term economic growth and regional collaboration.    despite the controversy, the allure of seeing taylor swift perform is undeniable, as evidenced by fans like 22-year-old indonesian citizen audilla ferialdi. ferialdi, along with countless others traveling from abroad, is injecting significant sums into singapore's economy, even though their home countries were not included on the tour schedule. her story exemplifies the power of celebrity culture to transcend geographical boundaries and generate economic activity, even if it raises questions about equitable distribution of benefits.    this situation lays bare the complex interplay between various forces. the immediate economic benefits for singapore are substantial, but the long-term implications and ethical considerations surrounding exclusive deals and the over-reliance on celebrity tourism warrant further discussion and potential reevaluation. as the music fades, a crucial conversation about regional collaboration, sustainable economic development, and fostering a spirit of inclusivity in the pursuit of shared prosperity in southeast asia takes center stage.",taylor swift's asia tour stirs some bad blood

1b4biez,ksxtr25,2024-03-02 01:13:47,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Dignity Kitchen hopes to raise $200,000 for restoration works after fire  

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Social enterprise Dignity Kitchen is hoping to raise $200,000 for restoration works after a fire damaged its premises on Feb 13. It has received over $23,000 from more than 200 people on crowdfunding platform Give Asia so far.

The organisation‚Äôs 10,600 sq ft premises at 69 Boon Keng Road were damaged after a fire in the rubbish collection centre next to its building spread, destroying its wall, roof, electrical items and air-conditioning units.

The incident, which occurred in the wee hours of the morning, has been classified as ‚Äúmischief by fire‚Äù and police investigations are ongoing.

Founder Koh Seng Choon, 65, told The Straits Times he was away in Hong Kong, where he has another Dignity Kitchen branch, when the incident happened. He returned to Singapore on Feb 28.

Dignity Kitchen is run by Project Dignity, a social enterprise founded in 2010 to create jobs for people with disabilities. Its Singapore branch comprises a full-functioning hawker centre open to the public, a culinary training centre, social outreach programmes, and secondhand book stalls.

Mr Koh told The Straits Times the training centre suffered the main damage. The quotation he received for repairing the exterior walls, as well as replacing the air-conditioning units and roof, amounted to about $130,000. However, the full extent of the damage cannot be assessed until the roof is removed. It will also take some time for his insurer to determine and process the payout.

Training makes up 30 to 40 per cent of Project Dignity‚Äôs total business revenue, he said. Dignity Learn, its inclusive training programme, provides Workforce Skills Qualification- and SkillsFuture-eligible hawker culinary courses for the public. It also runs a 22-day Train-and-Place programme for adults with special needs seeking employment.

Mr Koh said he has asked for urgent rewiring works and bought a portable air-conditioner to resume training classes, but lessons will have to stop again for about 12 weeks when restoration works are carried out. He added that he could not yet determine the total amount of revenue loss.

The food court, which has seven stalls manned by the differently abled and disadvantaged, resumed operations on Feb 19. Its operations include providing free box meals to 90 low-wage workers for dinner from Mondays to Fridays.

‚ÄúWe lost business at our food court for several days, including over Valentine‚Äôs Day and part of Chinese New Year,‚Äù Mr Koh said. ‚ÄúBusiness is picking up again now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have been through a lot of crises but we are still growing. One good thing that came out of this is that my team of over 100 staff handled the crisis well while I was away.‚Äù

Entrepreneur Vivian Pan, 39, donated $100 to Dignity Kitchen‚Äôs fund-raiser.

‚ÄúMr Koh is a humble man and good leader,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt give up and keeps fighting for his dream.‚Äù
