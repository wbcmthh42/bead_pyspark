1b1f5ob,kse1usp,2/27/2024 15:54,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Woman to be charged after US$4.2 million in cryptocurrency allegedly misappropriated 

SINGAPORE: A 31-year-old woman has been arrested after US$4.2 million in cryptocurrency was allegedly misappropriated.

She will be charged in court on Wednesday (Feb 28) for cheating and suspected involvement in money-laundering activities, the police said in a news release late on Tuesday.

The police said that they received a report on Feb 28 last year after US$4.2 million worth of United States Dollar Tether (USDT) belonging to a company was purportedly misappropriated by an employee.

The sum was said to have been misappropriated between May and August 2022 into cryptocurrency accounts allegedly belonging to the woman.

The police subsequently established the woman's identity through follow-up investigations. It was found that she had transferred the alleged sum to her cryptocurrency wallets and used it for various purchases.

Images of the purchases provided by the police show a pair of white slippers, accessories such as a bag and sunglasses, as well as a black car that appeared to be a Mercedes.

The items were seized as proceeds of crime, the police added.

The woman will be charged with the offence of cheating, furnishing false information and offences of converts of transfers under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking, and Other Serious Crimes Act (CDSA).

If found guilty of cheating, she faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine.

Those found guilty of furnishing false information face a jail term of up to three years, a fine of S$1,000 or both.

For converts of transfers under the CDSA, the offence carries an imprisonment term of up to 10 years, a fine of up to S$500,000, or both.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the early stages of PRC‚Äôs attempt to neo-colonialise Singapore. Keep making shows set in historical Singapore infused with modern day PRC shenanigans, once a critical mass is achieved, use the shows as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that we‚Äôre not so different. 

The show is supposedly about Samsui women in Singapore but other than plot mentions, it doesn‚Äôt feel like Singapore. They don‚Äôt even speak like Singaporean. You may argue that this was set in early days, so the early immigrants still speak like in their hometown. Even then, they should sound Southern Chinese. They‚Äôre of course speaking the standard PRC Mandarin that‚Äôs more Northern. 

You may argue, even in our own shows they speak in Mandarin, when historically they should speak in dialect. But it‚Äôs not just the language they speak, it‚Äôs how they speak. There is no attempt to make it realistic at all. In fact, I argue they want to portray the Samsui women as speaking like modern PRC women. See! We the same!!

Just a bit of a background. I'm working in an American NMC, parked under a client office in Singapore. 

Recently had a salary adjustment and it's very low, might be better to not increase at all tbh. I want to stay at my current company till at least 2025 due to personal circumstances. 

My relationship with my manager is pretty normal. We don't talk much, not very close with each other, but I assume we don't hate each other. Or maybe he hates me that's why my increment is low. I'm the only person under him. Whatever he askes me to do I'll just do it. During review my overall grade is ""meets expectation"", with a few outstanding and exceed expectation...etc. I know the company is doing well as recent townhall they have shown us the results.

and then yesterday I told my mom (because im closer to her) that I haven't started work at all for quite sometime because I honestly don't feel motivated to start at all. today she just almost spills the whole thing to my dad... ffs, never again.

So we were just talking about our lives, A was mentioning that he is getting nervous about his investments because it keeps going up (its now worth 6 digits), and he doesn't know how to manage it - whether to sell or keep holding etc. So we discussed and chipped in with advice (Realised 3/4 advice was from me). Later on we talked about other topics too so it's not solely on A problems. 

I thought it was a good/okay dinner, but later B told me about how she was (mildly) annoyed that A was humblebragging, and also jabbed at me because I couldn't tell and kept responding to him with ""attention"" to feed his story.

Can go explore S11 at 727 Clementi West Street 2, quite near hawker only, if you know where bluesg parking is, it's just there (behind the backside of bluesg cars). If you walking from hawker then you'll see chang cheng first, then walk out from the bread displays side you'll see bluesg parking lots. There got japanese dons, bcm and maze soba, the new western and claypot store all their stuff all nice also. Worth to take a look there for sure

There's one standalone shop selling char siew roast meat all that stuff and soups and even zichar stuff all that, just across the carpark road from 727, also not bad. If not can walk cross the other way to chang cheng coffeeshop, eat pig trotter rice, or lormee/luroufan, or eat korean fried chicken at waker chicken. 

Behind CC got small vietnamese shop and malaysian/penang food restaurant. 

Plaza can eat lunch set at baguo, or the korean food at L1, i nvr really eat the other stores so idk.

It's a problem that the government or rather PAP in this instance have dug themselves into and is impossible to change.


The most pressing concerns in today's climate are Housing and Aging Population yet any policies that have been implemented over the past decade has obviously not stopped the issue from worsening.


Housing - As housing prices continue to skyrocket, ""lottery winners"" of BTOs and people who already own a property will be happy to stick with status-quo due to higher resale and rent and thus profits. This however is having negative effects on the valuation of Singapore as a place to setup offices for MNCs as employee rental costs are a huge factor and remote working is much preferred nowadays to save on costs.


Aging Population - Somewhat linked to the problems caused by Housing, the younger generations have eyes and the smart ones can see that it is simply not viable to start a family while taking a significant hit to their standard of living. Importing new citizens was a viable tactic when housing/rental was not sky-high, but now it's becoming less and less enticing for foreigners to settle down in Singapore for the long term due to the cost of living.",Singapore must take on structural policy changes to keep growing: DPM Heng,16,0.77,2/28/2024,0

SINGAPORE: Large crowds are expected at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery, Choa Chu Kang Columbarium, Mandai Columbarium and Yishun Columbarium during peak periods in March and April, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Tuesday (Feb 27).

Crowds are expected on 13 peak days, comprising Good Friday (Mar 29), the Qing Ming festival (Apr 4), Hari Raya Puasa (Apr 10), and 10 Saturdays and Sundays between Mar 16 and Apr 14.

""Members of public are encouraged to consider visiting these facilities outside of the peak days during which large crowds are expected,"" said NEA.

To better manage the crowds, NEA said that the columbaria will be open 24 hours from Mar 16 to Apr 14.

Only next-of-kin with bookings and inland ash scattering permits will be allowed entry to the Garden of Peace at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery during the 13 peak days.

NEA said that this is to ""accord privacy"" to those who have applied for the ash scattering on those days.

The Garden of Peace will only be opened for visiting on weekdays between Mar 18 and Apr 12, the agency added.

Earlier this month, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng noted in parliament that demand for inland ash scattering has steadily increased since the first such facility, the Garden of Peace, was opened in 2021.

SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament (MPs) on Tuesday (Feb 27) extensively discussed Singapore‚Äôs future plans for artificial intelligence (AI) as well as government measures to help ITE students.

A total of 27 MPs and Nominated MPs spoke on day two of the Budget debate, which lasted around eight hours.

The debate kicked off on Monday and is expected to last until Wednesday. In all, 56 MPs are expected to speak before Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong wraps up the debate.

Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, delivered his Budget speech on Feb 16. He unveiled

measures that reflected findings from the Forward SG exercise, including details on better support for Institute of Technical Education graduates and schemes to uplift lower-income families, prompting analysts to call it a ‚Äúpro-social‚Äù Budget.

To bolster AI computing, talent and industry development, Mr Wong announced that more than S$1 billion (US$740 million) will be invested over the next five years.

The national broadband network will also be upgraded to support AI and immersive media technologies.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì A man who had to move out of his flat for assaulting his wife turned to his mother for help, but he ended up trying to sexually assault and strangle the 81-year-old woman one night after returning to her home in a drunken state.

On Feb 27, the recalcitrant offender, now 61, pleaded guilty to one charge each of attempted sexual assault by penetration, causing grievous hurt to his 60-year-old wife, and using criminal force on a police officer.

Another nine charges will be taken into consideration during sentencing.

Prosecutors described the man, who has 50 entries on his criminal records from 1982 to 2019, as a ‚Äúmenace to society‚Äù as they sought a sentence of preventive detention.

The case was adjourned after the High Court judge called for a report to assess if he was suitable for the regime, which detains repeat offenders for between seven and 20 years, for the protection of the public.

Over the years, the man had been fined and jailed for various offences including housebreaking, disorderly behaviour and criminal intimidation. In 1987, he was given 10 years‚Äô corrective training for culpable homicide.

After his most recent prison stint, he found work as a part-time driver, and lived with his wife and son, who was then 23 years old.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Delicia Tan said the accused has been an alcoholic for many years, and that his wife would not let him into the flat when he was intoxicated because he would become violent and have a ‚Äúhigh sex drive‚Äù.

On Jan 10, 2021, the man, who had earlier been drinking, asked his wife for sex. When she declined, he scolded her and threatened to break her face.

Later that night, he suddenly charged towards her and punched her hard in the face, causing her to fall backwards and hit the cupboard.

After their son pushed him away, the woman ran out to seek help.

She suffered a fractured nose, broken blood vessels in her eye, and a fractured finger, and was hospitalised for seven days.

Following the incident, she obtained a personal protection order, to restrain the man from committing family violence against her, as well as a domestic exclusion order, to restrict him from entering her home.

As a result, the man had to move out.

Secondly, the problem with MAS has nothing to do with bumi or non bumi or domestic vs international routes. MAS's problem is that the Malaysian government does not treat it as a business but as a vehicle for government policy. 

What do I mean? For one thing, MAS had, not sure if they still do, but MAS had flights to many destinations that may not be very popular. And the reason why is because being Malaysia's flag carrier, it was expected to fly to all destinations that Malaysia had diplomatic ties with.

SINGAPORE - At the age of 58, a Singaporean widower who had more than $10 million in assets met a 40-year-old woman through a dating agency in Taiwan.

He convinced her to move to Singapore and marry him here, but the marriage was short-lived.

Six months into the marriage, the woman returned to Taiwan and spent 10 months there. She flew back to Singapore after the man sent her $19,300.

After living with him for less than two months, she went back to Taiwan. He never saw her again.

The man succeeded in getting a divorce in Singapore.

In dividing the matrimonial assets, High Court judge Choo Han Teck said: ‚ÄúGiven that she brought nothing but grief to the marriage, and added nothing to it during its brief span, there is nothing that can be awarded to her.‚Äù

In his judgment on Feb 27, the judge ordered that each person would retain the assets that were in their sole names.

As for maintenance, Justice Choo said it was fair to award the woman a lump sum of $5,000 as a ‚Äúclean break‚Äù, given such a brief marriage.

‚ÄúThere is no evidence of what the defendant had done in her sojourn in Singapore, except that she was given $400 to $800 a month as allowance, in addition to the $19,300 that the plaintiff gave to cajole her to return to Singapore,‚Äù he said.

Justice Choo also commented on a lament the man had made in his affidavit.

The man, who has two adult children, said he had ‚Äúlonged for a supportive and peaceful relationship in (his) sunset years after being widowed, and this short-lived marriage has caused (him) much grief‚Äù.

The judge said: ‚ÄúFifty-eight is hardly sunset; it is more like mid-afternoon, so there should be no rush in looking for wife number three.‚Äù

The man and the woman met in October 2018, and they had a long-distance relationship for a year.

She was sceptical about adapting to life in Singapore, but he convinced her to move here in November 2019. They married on Dec 1, 2019.

The man worked as a manager and earned more than $66,000 a month. She has a degree in costume design, but did not have a known job.

Indeed. But considering what I've said about the other living expenses that's really just pocket money. It's not fully correct to say that she was given ""that little to survive on"", as if she had to pay rental/transport/food and the lot. 

Hard to believe that a 40yo woman doesn't have her own savings to live off of, or find new hobbies with. Worst case scenario, just chill at home for a bit.

SINGAPORE - A man who strangled his former fiancee in a budget hotel in Geylang in 2018 was hanged on Feb 28.

The Singapore Police Force (SPF) said the capital sentence was carried out on Bangladeshi national Ahmed Salim, 35, who had petitioned to the President for clemency but was unsuccessful.

This is the first judicial execution for murder in the Republic since 2019, a Singapore Prison Service (SPS) spokesman told The Straits Times on Feb 28, in response to queries. He added that it is the first execution in 2024.

Ahmed, a painter, had strangled Indonesian domestic worker Nurhidayati Wartono Surata in a room at the Golden Dragon Hotel on the evening of Dec 30, 2018, after she refused to leave another man she was seeing.

Ahmed was charged with murder on Jan 2, 2019, and sentenced to death on Dec 14, 2020.

An appeal against his conviction was dismissed on Jan 19, 2022.

SPF said Ahmed was accorded full due process under the law, and had access to legal counsel throughout the process.

According to statistics from SPS, the last person to be hanged for murder before Ahmed was in 2019, when there were two such judicial executions. There were four executions that year.

There were no judicial executions in 2020 and 2021, which SPS had previously said was not due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Instead, it said an execution is scheduled only after legal processes relevant to an inmate‚Äôs death sentence and legal applications taken out on their behalf, or which could affect them, are resolved.

In recent years, there have been multiple cases of murder charges being reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

They included a teenager who slashed a fellow student to death at River Valley High School in 2021. He was sentenced to 16 years‚Äô jail in Dec 2023.

In another case, Xavier Yap Jung Houn was sentenced to 14 years‚Äô jail in August 2023, after strangling his 11-year-old twins at a covered canal in Greenridge Crescent in 2022.

During Ahmed‚Äôs court proceedings, it was revealed that he and Ms Nurhidayati had started a relationship in May 2012 after a chance encounter.

They agreed to get married in December 2018, with Ahmed putting a ring on her finger at a party in 2017.

But she had an affair with a Bangladeshi plumber, Mr Shamin Shamizur Rahman, in mid-2018.

Ahmed confronted her after suspecting that she was cheating on him, and she admitted to dating another man.

Ahmed then asked his mother to help him look for a wife. She found one and arrangements were made for his wedding to take place in February 2019.

But a few months later, Ahmed and Ms Nurhidayati reconciled.

However, they quarrelled over her infidelity and on one occasion, while they were in a hotel room, Ahmed pressed a towel over her mouth. He let go after she struggled.

In late 2018, Ms Nurhidayati began talking to Bangladeshi general fitter Hanifa Mohammad Abu on Facebook.

She later told Mr Hanifa that she was in a relationship with Ahmed and promised she would make a clean break with Ahmed.

On Dec 9, 2018, Ms Nurhidayati told Ahmed that she had a new boyfriend and that he should return to Bangladesh for his arranged marriage.

While she told him during a meeting on Dec 23 that year that she would continue seeing him, she later broke up with him over a phone call.

Ahmed convinced her to meet him again seven days later and they had sex at a hotel.

He threatened to kill Ms Nurhidayati if she did not end her relationship with Mr Hanifa. When she refused, Ahmed strangled her with a towel.

A judge found that Ahmed had decided to kill Ms Nurhidayati even before Dec 30, 2018, so long as she refused to leave her new boyfriend and return to him.

This was because he had brought a rope to the hotel and had cleared out his bank account earlier on the day of the murder, among other things.

Ahmed was represented by a team of lawyers ‚Äì Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, Mr Chooi Jing Yen and Mr Hamza Malik.

On Feb 28, Mr Thuraisingam told ST that they had argued hard that Ahmed‚Äôs adjustment disorder had impaired his mental responsibility for the offence of murder, and that he should be spared the death penalty and be sentenced to life imprisonment instead.

He said: ‚ÄúWe were unable to convince the court of this. The court was of the view that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and he did not lose control of himself.‚Äù

Mr Thuraisingam, who has regularly taken on capital cases since 2012, was interviewed by ST recently on a feature on the mental and emotional toll faced by defence lawyers and prosecutors handling death penalty cases.

He spoke about the high stakes for defence lawyers who handle such cases.

On Ahmed, Mr Thuraisingam said: ‚ÄúWe gave it our all and really tried our best for him. It has, however, now come to a stage where the law has to take its course, and we have to accept and respect that.‚Äù

I like half day school, then the other half they go to grandparents house. If you are really a parent, and U have tried out a full day program, you ll know how often kids fall sick. And trust me the token 6 days a year is barely enough to last one fever episode.

Yet, ECDA has been steadily forcing all half day schools to become full day childcares. Not only pay more, not enough teachers, it ended up retiring all the experienced teachers. ECDA also under its nose allowed half day and full day programs to have more or less the same price. This pressures everyone to opt for full day, which confounds the lack of teacher situation.....

Anyone here dont believe, go see the full day price and half day price of any random pre school. Go talk to actual parents w kids in full day programs and find out how often kids fall sick. Go talk to pediatricians and see the incidence of how often kids get hospitalised these days ... its rilly failed policy making at its finest.

SINGAPORE - The resident total fertility rate (TFR) in Singapore dropped to below 1 for the first time in the Republic‚Äôs history.

Preliminary estimates indicate a resident TFR of 0.97 in 2023, said Minister in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) Indranee Rajah on Feb 28 in Parliament.

This figure remains below the replacement rate of 2.1 - the level at which a population replaces itself.

Speaking during the debate on the ministries‚Äô budgets on population issues, Ms Indranee said the TFR, which refers to the average number of babies each woman would have during her reproductive years, has continued to fall.

It fell from 1.04 in 2022 and 1.12 in 2021.

The latest figure places Singapore among countries with the lowest birth rates globally, with South Korea topping the list at 0.72 in 2023.

Ms Indranee, who oversees the National Population and Talent Division, which is under the Strategy Group in the PMO, said there were 26,500 resident marriages and 30,500 resident births in 2023.

‚ÄúOverall, however, there were fewer resident marriages and births annually on average over the last five years, as compared to the preceding five-year period.‚Äù

Singapore is confronted with the ‚Äútwin demographic challenges of a persistently low fertility rate and an ageing population‚Äù, she said.

These challenges are not unique to Singapore, she added. For example, European countries like Italy and Spain continue to see a record low number of births year-on-year, while neighbouring Malaysia and Thailand also saw their fertility rates fall in 2022.

Ms Indranee gave various reasons for Singapore‚Äôs low fertility, including temporal reasons such as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupting some couples‚Äô marriage and parenthood plans.

She added: ‚ÄúOthers cite concerns about the financial costs of child-raising, pressures to be an excellent parent, or difficulties managing work and family commitments.‚Äù

She said the falling numbers reflect a generational change in priorities, and young people may not even see marriage or parenthood as important life goals.

The falling TFR has serious implications for Singapore‚Äôs future, she added.

Families are getting smaller than before, and more couples have to care for both their children and their elderly parents.

She said: ‚ÄúWith fewer births, we will face a shrinking workforce. It will be increasingly challenging to maintain our dynamism, attract global businesses and create opportunities for the next generation.‚Äù

She added that countries such as South Korea and Itay have already experienced this, and they are grappling with economic slowdowns and falling wages - which are further compounded by low fertility rates and the resulting demographic changes.

In 2023, the Government announced various measures to support marriage and parenthood, including the doubling of Government-paid paternity leave to four weeks from January 1 and increasing Baby Bonus benefits.

It has also supported the adoption of flexible work arrangements as part of efforts to help working parents manage jobs and family commitments. On this front, a tripartite work group is developing guidelines on flexible work arrangements that will be compulsory for employers to follow once they are implemented later in 2024.

""Female Literacy Rate is a Better Predictor of Birth Rate and Infant Mortality Rate in India"" (2016) by P.H. Kulkarni. This study found a significant negative correlation between female literacy rates and the crude birth rate (CBR) in different Indian states.

""Female education and its impact on fertility"" (2013) by Monica Das Gupta. This research paper provides an overview of the various mechanisms through which female education can lead to lower fertility rates, including increased labor force participation, higher opportunity costs of childbearing, and greater access to family planning information and services.

""Female Education and Childbearing: A Closer Look at the Data"" (2014) by the World Bank.

Every incentive given to childbearing, comes from our pocket eventually. If the government is to pay more Baby bonus, that will increase the government budget and becomes the reason to increase taxes like GST.

Without much eugenics, Singapore children are just average, maybe slightly better. This is a mix of talented and not-so-talented. For those not-so-talented, Singapore has to protect them with policies with worker levy and quota, which in term increases the business cost. Immigration would allow Singapore to selectively offer permanent residence and voting rights to the talented ones, and temporary migration to those low cost workers; low cost workers are 'deported' when they retire, saving Singapore the burden of taking care of them.

In terms of conscription, the rationale so far has been that there is no urgent need for female conscription yet.

I've done a lot of introspection and realize just how much childhood trauma I've to deal with growing up, and how it's still following me through my life.

As a millennial, in terms of emotional labor, I feel like I am providing for (1) parents (2) the part of me that feels damaged from growing up in Singapore (3) myself. (4) partner

I no longer have any more energy to try and over extend myself to achieve some kind of KPI for a country that only treats its citizens as corporate slaves.

What I'm trying to say is that I'm saying the way our society and families were structured 30-40 years ago has cost millennials their mental health and general well-being. Boomers pulled the ladder up behind them, and the PAP only coddled them even more with lenient policies and enabling/creating an environment for non-physical abuse at home.

I hear the counter already - ""So what? We can depend on Immigrants, instead of filthy Sinkies"" - well, for one, if you talk to the well-educated Immigrants here, they (1) are planning to help their children leave this country, it's simply a springboard and (2) the conditions here are set up such that it results in the existing TFR. It doesn't matter if you are a local or a migrant. 

You can try to slowly genocide the current batch of ""Singaporeans"" off and mint new ones in the name of sustaining Singapore as an ""attractive regional hub"", but it's just going to be the same.

Just look at CEOs whose salaries/bonuses are tied to things like ""stock price"", they would do things like layoffs, even though it's not needed, just because it boosts stock price.

TFR based salary would mean that gahmen would do short-term solutions like ""free $10k cash, no strings, per baby"". You'd end up increasing TFR, but maybe it would be boosted due to lower incomes having babies just for cash and then neglecting the growth of their child. They would also vote for the government that does this, since they benefit from such short-term laws.

The gahmen, for all its flaws, is still aware that TFR cannot be raised ""at all costs"". If people don't want to have babies (e.g. maybe they hate children, don't feel right to bring life into a world that is being destroyed by climate change), they won't have babies, no matter the incentives.

I'd rather have low TFR and happy population than high TFR at all costs and all the ills associated with bad ""next generation"" (for instance, crime, neglected kids due to parents giving birth ""for the sake of $$$"").

I have seen some of my friends who choose to take sabbatical/change to a much lower paying job, but most of them fall in specific circumstances. Mostly single folks with no financial obligation, or not in Singapore currently.

Also, sabbatical/no pay leave requires a boss or organisation that supports it, which in our local context is not a given. So quite a few of them outright resign, which is a harder pill to swallow when there are financial obligations.

I have seen a few who choose to only work 0.5 to 2 full days a week and pass off promotions/further studies to raise kids, but those who go to such lengths all have spouses who earn so much that it doesn't matter.

I already premised it as no financial obligations and have enough savings. That means you have no worries at all, yet you do not want to entertain the thought of going on one.

Now, in reality, all of us have obligations/responsibilities. It could be mortgages, aged parents, children, etc. That is absolutely understandable and commonly known as ""adulting"".

I was like that before, heavily into the rat race, always chasing to keep up with the Joneses. I was exhausted. My wants increased in proportion with my increased salary. I was no longer satisfied with a two year old car when I see my colleague buy a brand new one, forgetting that just a few years earlier, I was taking the MRT. 

I then decided to stop. It wasn't easy, especially to see my peers advancing and I'm not. I sold off my car, not because I cannot afford it, but because I want to free up money. And it worked, but it was uncomfortable. People thought I have fallen on hard times. I wasn't. But that is just what people judge. I'm still drawing the same salary but suddenly I have an extra 2k every month. On top of that, I went through my spending with a fine tooth comb and cut back on ecesses.

Rather than asking for more, chasing for more, I made myself want LESS, and from it, I got more. 

I did what I can at work to get the job done, and I don't have to work late almost every day. So yes, you can say that I began ""silent quitting"" before it was a thing. I'm in my mid 40s, with two teenaged kids, I can do it, and I am still in the same job.

My question about taking a sabbatical is a ruse. The reasons you gave is exactly why I said that people are unwilling to give up progression/job. I already premised it as no financial obligations and have enough savings. That means you have no worries at all, yet you do not want to entertain the thought of going on one. This tells me that you, are like many of the Singaporeans I have spoke to, they are not willing to give up progression, are kiasu.

Let me preface that I'm a silent quitter myself who have outright told my boss to not put myself in the succession plans so I know that work life balance is possible, but it's not as straightforward as just saying it starts with u. BTW my spouse works part time now. That's what happens when cancer strikes in your marriage. Career is really irrelevant when u go through this.

There are folks who can't just be silent quit in their job, they have to quit/resign outright.

I have a rare couple of friends with 4, even one with 5 kids (rare Chinese folks) and the wife is stay at home cause it's easier to outright not work than to find a role that allows them to just work from 9 to 6 and pickup and fetch kids everyday on time, ""silent quit"". There are even who sold off their condo, downgrade to HDB to use the excess cash to do so.

I learned the realities in my first job in IT projects where we worked late nights and public holidays. My immediate manager (from Philippines)  have 3 kids, wife is stay at home. For those 2 years he did his best at doing the bare minimum yet he still worked late. I asked why not leave and get a new job or go back if it sucks? Cause he feels that education for his young kids is better here than back home. He was there for years after I left until he left his role.

There is a generalisation in the above reply that I don't agree with. There are other factors, many personal that is not obvious to outsiders.

Again - Just because one manages to do so doesn't mean that those who didn't do so didn't try/unwilling to sacrifice. I've seen enough EP/PR holders who eventually left SG for other jobs overseas even if they felt that education here is better for their kids cause they could not get the work life balance here in SG, even after changing jobs.

Not everything is absolute - I've learned through my conversation with others that not being caught between a rock and a hard place can be a privilege that people don't realise.","Singapore‚Äôs total fertility rate hits record low in 2023, falls to below 1 for first time",787,0.99,2/28/2024,0

1) The effect will be that there will be more time for citizens to be with their family, which they might also think it might be possible to start a family since they are now able to spent time with their family. 

This would really mean for the government to implement laws that only allow employers to contact employees after work hours only if there is a situation that will affect the existence of the company, like fire or financial fraud.

2) I'm not an expert with economy, but I think one of the effects will be maybe a dip in our economy? If prices are still high? One option might be for the government to implement price limitation on certain service? Like they can never go beyond a certain value. This would help families on the rising cost of living, which I think might also allow some couples to start a family.

And, statistically, Malays tend to be from the lower-income strata which does seem to suggest that perhaps financial strains isn‚Äôt the reason why couples are not having children (Not bashing, just stating facts, I‚Äôm Malay.) Generally, less developed countries also tend to have higher TFR, as compared to say Scandinavian counties with supportive policies like Sweden for example (480 days of parental leave!). While longer leaves, better financial support for families, family-friendly workplace policies etc. can be attractive incentives to have more babies, I think TFR will still continue to decline. Largely due to changing lifestyles and priorities, education, stable government and our world views in general. As to the reason why Malays have a higher TFR, I think this is due to cultural and/or religious influences and beliefs, and partly education. Some tend to be less educated, especially those from lower income families, hence lack of family planning or career ambitions etc. Of course, trends are changing and many more are becoming educated, which may again affect SG‚Äôs TFR in the future.

Historically, humans wanted children because (1) they can help with the family biz starting for Age 8 (e.g. work on farms, man shops) and became a net-gain and (2) no one had any education, and so education costs were non-existent and (3) there was no such thing as retirement funds, so you better had kids or you dead when your old and (4) women had very little opportunities get high income (5) limited housing making children very expensive, (5) widely available entertainment options that all scale with the number of kids you have in cost (e.g. eating out, travel) (6) contraceptives are widely available

Now we banned child labor, women can have high paying careers, education is a must and there is CPF and other means of socializing retirement costs - so having kids is now about as financial beneficial as having pets, with 10x the commitment. The amount of cost to raise a kid in SG is estimated to be \~0.5-1 million, and that's not including the opportunity cost due to lost promotions etc,!

It doesn't make much logical sense and contraceptives make the whole thing easy to avoid.

Want to fix it? There are two options - both involving removing (1) -(4) above, by no one is willing to do that. Basically one could

* Remove women's career opportunities, ban female education, ban contraceptives and go full Taliban.

Obvious that sucks, so maybe #2:

* Make it so lucrative to have children that it makes financial sense. This involves

1. Annual payout to couples who have children that is on par with a competitive career for at  home child-career (100k/annum min - with continue top-up payment even after child move out to account for lack of career progression, adjusted based on career prospects).
2. Government subsided entertained and luxuries and entertainment. All child plane tickets free with parents travel, all food orders for kids free when parents eat, all costs of movies etc. free for children with paying parent etc.

Only when society is willing to pay parents how much children are actually worth/cost to raise will we see people having more kids. But think about the extra taxes involved there... Its never going to fly, especially in a country with fewer kids.

As such, modern society is doomed to have far below replacement rates - and importing immigrants from places where raising kids is still financial beneficial (e.g. third-world). At this rate, eventually evolution will judge our modern way of life and being untenable and the society/culture that wins out will be Taliban with their women education/work ban.","Singapore‚Äôs total fertility rate hits record low in 2023, falls to below 1 for first time",787,0.99,2/29/2024,0

Without opening our borders to immigrants decades ago, our population will be falling right now. There were 30 000 births and 29 700 deaths in 2022. There will be more deaths than births on this island and the population will actually start *shrinking* rapidly instead of expanding in the next few decades. 

>South Korea & Japan are interesting case studies. On how population deflation can be managed without a significant fall in quality of life. 

They are literally the worst case studies when it comes to TFR. If you want to raise TFR and stop population decline, Japan and S.Korea are the last countries you should see as role models. Both countries are struggling with a rapidly ageing demographics. There are a lot of retirees taking govt money and not a lot of young tax paying workers to support and take care of them. It's not a sustainable situation and both s.korea and Japan are now more willing to invite more foreign workers over.

>Gander at how other developed economies are turning right wing or even full Nazis

So we should turn right wing and even full on become Nazis when it comes to immigration? You statistically know someone who is a foreigner since 40% of this island's population is not born here.

>You don‚Äôt double down on 10 million. To write off all the friction on unwarranted xenophobia. When foreigners find our condos more affordable than NS men.

Who said 10 million is the target? Also most of the 2 million foreigners here aren't rich and living in condos. You can be an NS men and live in a condo. Why do you need to see the world as simply black and white?

>Bit aggro chasing people born here to leave, xenophillia & simply $ faced?

As a supervisor myself, my answer is ""Yes"". And the reason is simple, he/she is rewarded for the time and effort put in. **It is not a punishment for Person A who is doing ""normal"" work.** Person B is just better, with the tangible results to show for it.

1b20unj,ksiingy,2/28/2024 9:50,PT91T,">what's the difference between advancing washington's interests vs amazon's interests? why is one dangerous but the other okay?

Obviously both are bad, our government should not be beholden or manipulated by other interests. But being influenced by a foreign country is far far more dangerous since it opens questions of national security like spying or creating divisions within society (e.g. attacking SG's identity by saying we should be loyal to our mother race). 

At the very best, they want to change Singapore's geopolitical/military alignment to their country's benefit and harm our existing ties with competitors. Either way, foreign countries are solely dedicated to advancing their own country's interests (unless they themselves are puppeted by a mastermind state). In that light, a company would also not let another company have power over its decisions; Pepsi would never take orders from Coca Cola.

Corporate interests/lobbying directed towards a govt is also bad since you end up like the US where big companies are gifted with giant tax breaks but they're not usually existentially threatening unless you live in a cyberpunk reality (say Arasaka Corp which controls much of the economy). And they're not typically at odds with our national security or societal interests (it's more financial and corruption-related than interfering in politics/society).

Any big MNC is after all just one of the many hundreds or even thousands which operate in SG (any MNCs themselves do not constitute a majority of our economy either). And companies just want money through bigger business, they have little interest in SG going down the toilet since that's all their investments going down the drain too.

>personally I don't see anything wrong with lobbying as long as it is done openly. no need to close shop, just designate them as politically significant persons like what has been done with this china guy. 

Corporate lobbying sure I think. I would put a stop to foreign lobbying if they're a Singaporean citizen since the SG passport comes with obligations of loyalty (it's like an SAF soldier helping Malaysia's intelligence services). Of course, if they're a foreign national then sure I guess but they should be registered and declared as such.

>let's not forget that prior to that she had informed her party and it raised no objections.

Yeah, I was pretty disappointed in that case too. I would think that sorta appointment is highly inappropriate for an MP. At least MPs have little executive power or responsibilities (that's why they're allowed to have full-time jobs in the first place) but she could still influence govt policy for Grab.

I guess it's a bit difficult to assess since you can't expect MPs to not work and parliamentary conduct would whack you if you were advocating for your company's interests in any political matter.",Analysis: Why Philip Chan was deemed to have 'crossed a red line' under Singapore's foreign interference law,90,0.92,2/28/2024,0

SINGAPORE: Some commuters who had switched to using SimplyGo EZ-Link cards can soon collect another card that will allow them to see their fare balances under the old ticketing system.

This applies to the group of adult commuters who converted to SimplyGo or purchased a SimplyGo EZ-Link card between Jan 9 and Jan 22 - before authorities reversed a decision to phase out the older EZ-Link ticketing system.

These commuters can pick up their EZ-Link card for free from Mar 18 to Jun 30 - depending on their SimplyGo EZ-Link card identification number.

It can be done at any of the SimplyGo ticket offices.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced the collection details on Wednesday (Feb 28), about a month after rolling back plans to phase out the old system in favour of SimplyGo following complaints.

The older card-based ticketing (CBT) system for adult commuters will now be in place until at least 2030.

For adult commuters who purchased a NETS Prepaid Card between Jan 9 and Jan 22, they can collect a free NETS FlashPay card anytime from Apr 1 to Jun 30.

The NETS FlashPay card comes under the CBT system.

With a CBT card, commuters can see their fare deductions and card balances when they tap out at fare gates and bus card readers. This is currently not possible with SimplyGo cards and was a common gripe among those who were against switching to SimplyGo.

Issuing new CBT cards provides an option for eligible commuters who do not wish to continue using their current SimplyGo card.

SINGAPORE - The High Commission of Malaysia in Singapore caught some Malaysians by surprise when it suddenly announced on Feb 26 that it would limit its consular counter services to 70 cases a day.

The change took effect on Feb 27.

Queue numbers, which are subject to availability, are issued at the guard house from 8am, the High Commission said in a notice dated Feb 26 on its website. The notice was shared on its Facebook page that day.

The affected services include birth registration, marriage registration, document attestation and death registration.

The sudden announcement has left some Malaysians concerned and annoyed over the inconvenience that the move brings.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why (the High Commission makes) an announcement just a day before (the implementation). I came yesterday, then I can‚Äôt get my thing done. I came today (and there‚Äôs now) the 70 (cases) quota,‚Äù a person using the handle Gxf Cai commented on the High Commission‚Äôs Facebook page on Feb 27 after being turned away.

Gxf Cai reported making another trip the next day, and managing to get in after queueing for half an hour.

Gxf Cai later told The Straits Times that the queue was mixed with people who needed consular services and other services, so those at the far end of the line would not know if they would be among the lucky 70.

‚ÄúPeople might take leave from work to get this done, but they can‚Äôt get the number and need to come another day, and yet you won‚Äôt know whether you can secure the slot or not,‚Äù said Gxf Cai.

Some other Malaysians wondered if appointments could be made online. ‚ÄúAny online appointment booking service? What if you make a trip down to find out all 70 numbers have (been) issued for that day?‚Äù asked Facebook user Miracle Holmes.

Some Malaysians, however, said they are unaffected by the change.

Senior storekeeper Tan Tiam Lai, 49, who has been working in Singapore for about 30 years, said he usually applies for services such as passport renewal online.

There were 1.13 million Malaysian migrants residing in Singapore as at 2022, according to numbers given in 2023 by Malaysia‚Äôs then Human Resources Minister V. Sivakumar.

ST has contacted the High Commission for more information.

Increasing taxation on land use would drive more efficient use of land. 

We should also start an occupancy rate tax on properties, both private and commercial to reduce properties sitting empty.

SINGAPORE - Singapore‚Äôs fair and progressive fiscal system ensures that those with greater needs, particularly lower-income families, receive more assistance than what they pay in taxes, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said on Feb 28.

The Government‚Äôs long-term and prudent approach has enabled it to keep expenditure at less than 20 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and hence keep the tax burden low, DPM Wong added, as he addressed MPs‚Äô comments on the Budget statement he had delivered on Feb 16.

DPM Wong, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Singapore does better than advanced economies such as the United Kingdom and Finland in terms of the benefit-to-tax ratio, especially for lower- and middle-income households.

For example, the lowest 20 per cent of households in Singapore receive about $4 in benefits for every dollar of tax paid, which is higher than the benefit-to-tax ratio of about 3.5 in the United Kingdom and Finland.

The middle 20 per cent of Singapore‚Äôs households receive about $2 for every dollar of taxes paid, more than the UK‚Äôs benefit-to-tax ratio of 1.2.

Meanwhile, the top 20 per cent of households here receive about 30 cents for every dollar that they pay in taxes, similar to Finland‚Äôs benefit-to-tax ratio of about 0.3.

Mr Wong added that the benefits cited in these figures do not include other intangible benefits such as access to quality education, healthcare and housing.

The second part of my post seeks precisely to moderate the negatives you said. Taxing on occupancy rates would act to drive rent rates downwards in both private and commercial properties more than any cooling measure. 

Moreover by taxing land owners, you eventually convert more landed and lower density private properties which are less efficient in land use into high density properties. Which, will increase housing availability and act as downwards pressure on housing pricing. 

In the UK, implementing land value tax actually served to break up large estates into more useful smaller parcels of land. 

Taxing land is more efficient and fair compared increasing GST and income tax.

SINGAPORE ‚Äî The closure of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Special Account is not aimed at helping the Government to save on higher interest it pays out to such account holders, said Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng in Parliament on Wednesday (28 Feb).

Dr Tan, who is also the Second Minister for Trade and Industry, was responding to Mr Leong Mun Wai of Progress Singapore Party at the conclusion on a debate on Budget 2024.

After Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had delivered a round-up speech following three days of debate, Mr Leong rose to ask several questions.

One question was on how much more the Government is currently paying to Special Account holders because of the difference in interest rates between the Special Account and the Ordinary Account.

Mr Wong said that he did not have the specifics on the additional amount that the Government is paying and that this can be addressed at the upcoming debate on the Ministry of Manpower's budget.

Mr Wong reiterated the Government's rationale for the closure of the Special Account, adding that with other CPF changes he has announced, Singaporeans can benefit from higher retirement payouts through CPF Life, which many observers have said is the best annuity product in the market today.

Dr Tan then rose to address Mr Leong's point.

‚ÄúI think it's important members of the House understand that the closure of the Special Account is not aimed at saving interest monies,‚Äù said Dr Tan, who added that he will provide a fuller explanation during his ministry's budget debate.

The CPF Board is a statutory board under the ministry.

Currently, Singaporeans aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for retirement payouts: Special Account and Retirement Account.

Both earn the same interest rate, which is now 4.08 per cent, higher than the 2.5 per cent for Ordinary Account.

DPM Wong had announced in his Budget 2024 speech on Feb 16 that from 2025, the CPF Special Account of those aged 55 and above will be automatically closed, and the money in there, up to the Full Retirement Sum, will be transferred to their Retirement Account.

The balance will then go into their Ordinary Account.

Concurrently, the Government will raise the Enhanced Retirement Sum, which is the maximum amount that people can put into their CPF Retirement Account to receive monthly payouts after they turn 65.

The Enhanced Retirement Sum will be raised to four times the Basic Retirement Sum, up from the current three times.

The change to the Special Account is part of the Government‚Äôs move ‚Äúto rationalise the CPF system‚Äù, said Mr Wong on Feb 16.

The Ministry of Finance has explained that currently, like Ordinary Account savings, some money in the Special Account can be withdrawn from age 55. However, this goes against the principle where only money that cannot be withdrawn from CPF earn higher long-term interest rate.

Making a similar point in his response to Mr Leong on Wednesday, Dr Tan said: ‚ÄúI don't think that there's any system in the world, any financial institution in the world, any bank in the world, that will pay a long-term assured fixed deposit interest rate but to allow you the flexibility to withdraw like an ATM machine.‚Äù

The CPF Board has said that with the increase in the Enhanced Retirement Sum, more than 99 per cent of the roughly 1.4 million CPF members above the age of 55 can transfer all their Special Account savings to their Retirement Account, a point reiterated by Dr Tan on Wednesday.

He said that those who want flexibility after 55 years can still leave their monies in the Ordinary Account, which they can also use for investment purposes if they like.

‚ÄúSo this (the CPF policy changes) is not about saving money (for the Government). It is not about locking up money,‚Äù continued Dr Tan.

‚ÄúIn fact, if anything at all, at age 70, the CPF Board doesn't have any option for members to continue to accumulate. If there's such a word, at 70, everyone has to de-cumulate. I hope that clarifies.‚Äù



He is referring to the oldest age that the CPF Board allows members to start their CPF Life monthly payouts. According to the CPF Board‚Äôs website, this is ‚Äúto facilitate effective decumulation of CPF savings during (a) member‚Äôs lifetime‚Äô‚Äô.

Not an excess u can choose to take out. If u can take out an amount past FRS ur CPF life payout will drop even if u kept FRS.

Again, I‚Äôm not removing the option to opt for ERS. The current options still exist, my proposal adds another option instead. 

Yes that is correct, I‚Äôm referring to the FRS for the cohort. Both the 200k at 55 or 300k at 65 from the RA are somewhat equivalent.

To make it clear, I am proposing all SA sums will move to the RA at 55 (no cap), then all sums at cohort FRS is earmarked for CPF life. All sums above that FRS is free for withdrawal, all while retaining the 4% interest rates.

While this might limit its combat operations when runways are damaged or unavailable, the F-35A makes up for it with its exceptional air-to-air capabilities and advanced sensors.

The F-35Bs are a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, which allows it to operate from shorter and more austere runways.  This versatility is particularly useful for Singaproe as we have limited land space and may not always have access to long runways.  Plus, the F-35B's ability to take off vertically means it can quickly respond to threats from any direction, giving us an edge in combat situations.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will acquire eight F-35A fighter aircraft, complementing the previously announced purchase of 12 F-35Bs, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.

This comes as the fifth-generation stealth planes made by United States manufacturer Lockheed Martin have been proven on the battlefield, Dr Ng said during the debate on the Ministry of Defence‚Äôs (Mindef) budget on Feb 28. The eight F-35As will arrive around 2030.

The announcement followed Mindef‚Äôs 2023 decision to buy eight F-35Bs, after an initial purchase of four F-35Bs in 2020.

The two F-35 variants have different strengths that will bolster the RSAF‚Äôs capabilities, Dr Ng told Parliament.

‚ÄúThe F-35As are designed for greater endurance and have the ability to carry payloads of higher capacity,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThey complement the F-35Bs‚Äô short take-off and vertical landing capability...which provides more operational flexibility (in land-scarce Singapore).‚Äù

Dr Ng noted that over 900 F-35s have flown in operations around the world that included strikes against ISIS in the Middle East and reconnaissance missions to locate and identify surface-to-air missile sites of Russian units in Ukraine.

Its battlefield successes have prompted several more countries, such as Switzerland and Germany, to jump on board the programme, while existing customers such as South Korea, Japan and Britain have placed additional orders.

With close to 2,500 F-35s on order globally, the pipeline is healthy and the price is now more competitive, comparable with Boeing‚Äôs F-15EX, he noted. The F-15EX is an upgraded version of the F-15 fighter, though it is still considered a fourth-generation jet.

While Mindef did not say how much the eight F-35As will cost, figures released by the US indicate that in its latest production lot, each F-35A will cost US$82.5 million (S$111 million), while a single F-35B costs US$109 million.

Dr Ng noted that Mindef and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) may have to deprioritise other projects to buy during this window of opportunity. ‚ÄúBut we have done our calculations, and we think this is the best time to put in the order for F-35As,‚Äù he said.

When the F-35s become operational, they will put the RSAF ‚Äúin the premier league‚Äù, he added.

Delivery of the first four F-35Bs is expected in 2026, with the other eight in 2028, said Dr Ng.

They will replace the RSAF‚Äôs ageing F-16 jets, which have been in service since 1998.

The F-16s have progressively been upgraded with modern sensors and weaponry to keep them operationally ready until the mid-2030s.

Together with the F-15SGs ‚Äì which attained full operational capability in 2013 ‚Äì the air force will have a fleet that is capable of performing the full suite of missions required to defend Singapore‚Äôs skies, said Dr Ng. ‚ÄúThis will be a capable air force, above all, to protect our skies,‚Äù he said.

The JMMS (160/170) concepts by ST will not be able to support F-35B. To cater for F-35B / STOVL aircraft you'll also need a more specialised/harder deck coating compared to a normal helicopter carrier to cater for the downwards jet blasts.

Also, hangar space required for storing the planes + spares + weapons will be significant and the tradeoff would be the well deck/hangar space for vehicles, if you still want to maintain amphibious capability. At 160m/170m length, you'll have to choose one or the other.

  
Also to operate carriers you'll need a large number of personnel, which Singapore lacks. We just do not have the manpower for multiple carriers.","RSAF to acquire eight F-35A fighter jets, growing its fleet to 20 F-35s",200,0.93,2/28/2024,0

Again, I listed the significant disadvantages it has compared to the A variant and you just shrugged it off. The larger airframe and foldable wings compromises stealth and kinetic performances. An F-35A combat radius is matched or probably even better than a CFT F16, an aircraft it is replacing. F-35A with full internal payload will out range, manoeuvre and speed an F16 with CFT, external tanks, targeting pods and the same loadout. There is no reason to have external tanks on the F-35 because the range is just ridiculous. Lastly, the only operators of the C variant is USN and USMC. Which means the production line of it will cost significantly more than the A variant. A simple search online shows that each costs 20 million more. So, for 20 million more per plane, do you think a slight increase in combat radius at the cost of agility and a bit of stealth is worth? Also, I want to add on that both variants can achieve mach 1.6, however, it takes significantly longer on the C variant and it is not able to maintain supersonic for long.

Edit: I just went to do some research and the F-35C has a shocking 1nm further combat radius over the A variant!","RSAF to acquire eight F-35A fighter jets, growing its fleet to 20 F-35s",200,0.93,2/29/2024,0

As such, they are probably relooking at the requirements of the JMMS/LST replacement as to whether they want to have the F35B capability on it. If they do decide on it, I personally do not think the Endurance 160/170 platform is sufficient. They'd probably need some sort of a modified Juan Carlos I / Trieste type platform.

IMO, it's kind of immature to ask how we're going to recover the $40 billion, as this seems to suggest they do not actually have a solid plan, as like all shrewd business person, they will always have a plan B to backup plan A, and a plan C to backup plan A&B.  and companies like microsoft actually have what they call a battle chest, filled with lots of money which they can use in case they got involve in a law suite or whatever emergency, and Singapore being so tiny to the world, we're technically very vulnerable.  Hence, there should already be some kind of plans where part of our reserve can be use for..  But now it seems like they just want to hold on to it like our granny saving money in a milo tin and they don't care what happen, even the cloud falls on them they will still hold on tightly to that milo tin and then question.  If the money is used, then no more already, and how will I get the money back,  so nobody cannot touch, until some ended up having the tin stolen, eaten by rats or they hide it so well nobody can find it.  

The PAP argument in my own personal opinion is like coming from old folks.   But having said..  We all think we are rich, but are we really that rich?  maybe all we have now is only $60 billion left in the reserve? and $40 billion taken out for covid, we're now left with only $20 billion, and our defense minister wants to buy F35 and transport need money to maintain EZ link..  Hence, $20 billion really not enough, and this is why they're asking.  You teach me how to make $40 billion..  KNN.

SINGAPORE ‚Äî Some countries might plan and debate their budgets based on ‚Äúfiscal fantasies‚Äù, but the Singapore Government ensures its commitments are properly funded and focuses on fiscal prudence and responsibility, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said.

Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, made this point in his speech rounding up the Budget debate in Parliament on Wednesday (Feb 28), as he called on all members of the House to commit to upholding fiscal responsibility and discipline.

‚ÄúAnd if the opposition parties have a different view on this, I invite them to take up the challenge that the prime minister issued in this House a few weeks ago: Make drawing more from the reserves an election issue,"" Mr Wong added.

‚ÄúLet's go to the people... Ultimately, Singaporeans can decide what is the best fiscal approach to take Singapore forward.‚Äù

After his speech, Members of Parliament (MPs) from the opposition parties, including Workers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh, rejected Mr Wong‚Äôs statement that they wanted to dip into the national reserves, and did not respond to his challenge to take the issue to the ballot box.

Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, MP for Potong Pasir constituency from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), also waded into the debate to challenge Mr Singh on WP's stance regarding the use of the reserves.

The following is an extract of their exchange, edited for brevity and clarity.

Mr Singh: (On the) subject matter that the deputy prime minister covered, about usage of reserves and so forth... I think it didn't come up in this debate but in previous debates, where we talked about how we can make up for funding gaps vis-a-vis GST (Goods and Services Tax) and all that.

Mr Wong: I thank him for his clarification, but perhaps he could also clarify, because the Workers‚Äô Party had previously objected to GST and eventually accepted the GST at 7 per cent.

But (during the debate) about the two-percentage-point increase in GST, the options and alternatives that the Workers' Party advocated were: Use the reserves, increase the net investment returns (from the reserves), do this instead of (raising) GST.

Now that we have implemented (9 per cent) GST ‚Äî the Workers' Party said that with the 7 per cent, ‚ÄòNow that it's done, we've accepted it‚Äô ‚Äî perhaps Mr Singh might clarify, perhaps the Workers' Party would accept the 9 per cent as a reality?

And would you then also say that the proposals to use more of the reserves... are therefore no longer relevant, and that the Workers‚Äô Party is fully consistent with the PAP when it comes to our framework and rules for the use of the reserves?

Mr Singh: I would say that when we make proposals, it is in the context of what is before us at that point in time... Now, by and large, I think the vision or whatever is before the Workers‚Äô Party in particular, I can't speak for the entire Opposition, but we will have to work with the information that we have. We are not in government. And if it means that we have to look at all options, we will look at all options.

Mr Wong: The basic point I was getting at is whether or not there was a difference, and there is a difference in our fundamental fiscal philosophy.

And I think that's important, because there was a time when there was alignment in this House between the PAP and the Workers‚Äô Party. There was a time under Mr Low Thia Kiang (former WP secretary-general) when it was very clear ‚Äî the ethos of fiscal responsibility was the same across both sides of the House. It seemed to me that this had changed under Mr Pritam Singh.

And the Workers' Party, of course, is free to change its position. But I think it should be clear if this is so.

As far as the PAP is concerned, our position is quite clear. Doesn't mean that policies cannot change. Of course, we review, circumstances change, we update our policies.

But when it comes to certain fundamental principles and values like fiscal responsibility, a basic orientation not just to look at today, but for the future, this must never be compromised. This must never change.

These principles were put in place by our founding leaders. They have continued under successive leaders of the PAP and they will certainly continue under my watch.

Mr Singh: I think I've heard this before in this House.

The point again, I would make in response to that, is indeed, I do agree with the finance minister, policies change.

The PAP Government yesterday would return the money that it had used from the reserves as a matter of principle, but today the PAP Government may not return the money it uses from the reserves. That's my response.

Mr Sitoh: (Mr Singh) mentioned that the current PAP Government does not return reserves to its people whereas the past one did so. I don‚Äôt understand him, because aren't returns from NIRC (Net Investment Returns Contribution) a way of returning money to the people? Unless he's talking about a drawdown on the reserves.

Mr Singh: Mr Sitoh Yi Pin, the response that I gave to the deputy prime minister is a point of fact, it was in response to what he said about Mr Low having a certain position on the reserves, and that it has changed under me. I think this must be the third time he's mentioned it in this House and I've responded to it before and I responded to it the last time as well.

Global financial crisis ‚Äî Government draws down, returns the money. And I think there were some statements made about why it was doing that.

This time round, reserves are used for another emergency, and they're not returned. Just a simple statement of fact. Positions change.

Mr Sitoh: So is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that the Government has to top up the reserves (drawn) during Covid? Because that would be a massive amount. How are we going to fund it then?

Mr Singh: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, you've just made the case that I was making: In one situation you can, another situation you can't. You have to look at the statements made when the money was returned, and then you see in a different situation, a different context, there's a different explanation.

Mr Sitoh: Can the Workers‚Äô Party teach me ‚Äî assuming (hypothetically) you're in government now ‚Äî how do you top up S$40 billion?

Mr Singh: I don't mean to belabour this because we're going to get into hypotheticals here. But the Government announced a 24-month instalment for property tax in this Budget. You can pay by instalments, can't you? Perhaps that could be a way.

Mr Sitoh: I think surely, if we can get a S$40 billion surplus over the next X number of years, sure, it's a happy problem, but teach me how you're going to do that.

Mr Singh: Mr Speaker, I think I don't need to prolong this. Member hasn't answered the point on instalments.

1b25987,ksjo2qp,2/28/2024 15:26,sa_ranoutofideas,"From your comment, i'm sure you're aware of this but the way Lee Hsien Loong explained it, the 50% split was plucked from thin air:

""There is no magic rule to this, but we arrived at a split of 50-50. There is a certain simplicity and fairness to that; a natural division that we settled on between the President and the government. It is simple, it is intuitive, everybody can understand it. We split the difference between now and the future. And so in 2001, Parliament passed a constitutional amendment to protect 50% of NII, and add that to the reserves. And the other 50%, the government of the day could spend. 50% for the present, 50% for the future.

...

In 2008 we amended the tion again, to specify that the government would spend out of Net Investment Returns (NIR) instead of NII. But we kept the 50% rule: The Government could spend 50% of Net Investment Returns, instead of 50% of Net Investment Income. We called this amount, which the Government can draw from the reserves and add to the annual budget to spend, the NIRC (Net Investment Return Contribution). This is how we arrived at today‚Äôs system of spending half of investment returns and saving the other half, after decades of refining and improving the system, testing it out, making sure that it works as intended.""

Perhaps they want to also hide the formula they use to have determined that 50% was the right figure and they have most definitely stress-tested it to ensure it is sustainable. 

But yeah, when the variables are known to only one party, it is difficult to propose other limits. And for some reason, only PAP's thresholds are correct even though they themselves have admitted that these thresholds have changed several times i.e. 100% NII --> 50% NII --> 50% NIR

1b25987,ksnvdlk,2/29/2024 6:53,SuitableStill368,"Advocating for fiscal spending and doling out incentives are compelling narratives for politicians, typically met with little resistance when proposing to dip into reserves for immediate benefits. However, it‚Äôs crucial for the government (running team) and the established system to exercise restraint.

At present, the current government is grappling with the ongoing task of balancing income, primarily through taxation, while also strategizing for increased fiscal spending. Conversely, the opposition doesn‚Äôt need to contend with these. It may appear that the current government is being tough. But like all parents who have varying expenses, they are merely doing the best with what they have.

From my standpoint, I firmly believe that raising taxes is essential to assist the most vulnerable segments of society and address escalating healthcare costs. Yet, discussing tax hikes is never a popular topic; they represent harsh realities that are difficult to broach and implement. Insofar, I have only seen oppositions being against tax hikes, while supporting having more spending needs and reserves for long-term spendings. It is not that the latter two are always bad, but not wanting to act on or talk about raising taxes any time sooner is disappointing in my view. Because that‚Äôs the hard truth.

Politicians who prioritize long-term governance must confront and communicate about these tough decisions. History has shown that many of these decisions, though challenging, bear fruitful results, granting us a competitive edge in the region and allowing us to navigate a world where the powerful dominate the weak.

I support the idea that NS doesn't have to be solely under MHA.

Even training a handful of interested people (say, those with diplomas/uni placement in healthcare) under MOH or getting more manpower for social services (even just junior admin staffs) would alleviate a lot of pressure from our healthcare/social sectors.

NIE-placed students can also serve their NS as trainee teachers or admin for MOE.

Literally win-win, more relevant career experience for those serving, and more manpower for these crunched sectors.

Sources indicate that Blue Spear does appear to have land attack capability as well.

As for aircraft carriers, we do not have the necessary manpower to even operate one, much less an entire carrier escort group.

Besides, Tomahawks and Aircraft Carriers are considered to be offensive / for power projection which go against our military strategy.

Look, Singapore's defence strategy has always been two-pronged, diplomacy and deterrence. And in order to maintain that deterrence, our military strength has to always stay ahead of the game. These F-35 purchases will only be delivered progressively from 2026 (first 4 F-35Bs), 2028 (next 8) and 2030 (F-35A) onwards. Upon taking delivery, we still have to train our pilots and it will be even longer before we achieve operational capability. Beyond 2030 our F-16s would be >30 years old. Do we want to wait for our equipment to be obsolete before we even start looking for their replacements and then wait again to take delivery?

In order to strengthen our diplomatic ties we also regularly provide HADR (Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief) to our partners in the region (Tsunami in 2004, Airasia/MH370 searches, Australian wildfires). These also require us to have the capability and equipment to do so.

Our perceived military strength, cordial diplomatic relations with many countries, and the security it provides is a key attraction for foreign investors to set up shop in Singapore, which benefits our economy (and therefore govt revenue) to a greater magnitude than the amount we spend on our defence budget.

Our economy is also heavily reliant on trade and the Malacca strait is one of the busiest trade routes in the world. We need to be able to protect our SLOCs. If someone up north were to blockade the Malacca strait to prevent trade from going through to us, our economy would crumble. The Invincible-class submarines and upcoming MRCVs will play a part in protecting the SLOCs too.

Of course we still have to spend on our social and healthcare infrastructure, which we are already spending on. The key is to find that balance and not completely disregard one just to focus on the other.

You might say Singapore will never go into conflict so there is no point in having such a strong/overpowered military, but look at Ukraine, conflict can arise out of nowhere. If you only decide to focus on your defence once there is a credible defence risk, it's gonna be too late.

Conventional fighter jets just can't compete because they simply cannot detect stealth fighters

We probably want enough F-35s and complement them with a larger fleet of 4th gen fighters

I'm more worried about the upkeep of the f-35, they have a long least of problems, the maintenance is insanely expensive and minor issues can basically incapacitate a new plane. If we have other options besides f-35, Im all for exploring that

1b25lnl,ksmifgr,2/29/2024 0:54,Elyx117,"There are some fine points which I obviously agree with. I'll just highlight a few problems I see in your argument.

1.The Ukraine-Russia war did not come *out of nowhere* for god's sake. Anyone who knows even a spit about Cold War history, about Putin and indeed about the fact that the current war is part of a decade long conflict wouldn't have said that. Of course you know, so please spare me that PAP existential scare tactic. The geopolitical dynamics within this region are messy and sometimes prone to petty brinkmanship, but a far cry away from the warzone that you seem to think we're in - if that's the case please cancel the rail projects with boleh land now because Israel wouldn't have done that with Lebanon in a million years.

2. Speaking of Israel - how much help were the F35s in deterring Hamas from launching the first major invasion since Yom Kippur? Exactly. 5th gen air superiority fighters are power projection tools first and foremost, therefore they go against the military strategy that you described for Singapore. They are not for defense, not for deterrence, they are designed for the likes of Israel and Korea so that when they do need to bomb Tehran or Pyongyang, they can. As I noted above, I do not think Singapore is even remotely facing that sort of security urgency, thanks in part to the massive military budget yes but my point is, we have to draw a line somewhere in terms of fiscal prudence.

Wait... did you just say F35s can be used for humanitarian missions? They can, but not even the Americans do that, what a waste of resource.

3. I go back to what I said in my OP... this wouldn't have been an issue if the government isn't out there crying everyday about how we're broke and need more money. Need money for your chemo? Then you shouldn't have bought that Rolex. I believe this country has a far FAR more urgent need to boost its healthcare resources and infrastructure, and as a taxpayer that's where I want my money. Instead of buying more warplanes, instead of preparing for bombing runs on Jakarta and KL, we need more nurses, more beds, more senior care facilities, so that I don't have to listen to this government telling us not to go to hospitals in a pandemic or that we should send our elderlies to nursing homes in fking JB because we're broke af and can't spend more. Except on F35s.",Committee of Supply 2024: MINDEF,587,0.95,2/29/2024,0
1b25lnl,ksnhuzu,2/29/2024 4:49,Beth-Harmon,Yeah I think it's the best we annex ourselves to a stronger country of our choice who will treat us as a worker before another less friendly country comes along to invade us.,Committee of Supply 2024: MINDEF,587,0.95,2/29/2024,0
1b25lnl,ksp3xz6,2/29/2024 14:17,wqtrigger,"1. I'm not saying they are the same, no one conflict is the same. Obviously for different territories/political landscapes etc there are different factors leading into conflict. But if you can't see the similarities and/or look back at our history (Konfrontasi, Exercise Pukul Habis etc) to see why it is better to be safe than sorry in terms of having a strong military presence then I can't help you there. Not saying it will happen, but it only takes someone radical in a neighbouring country gaining influence/power, drumming up nationalistic sentiments and risking spillover into conflicts



2. I did not say F35s would be used for HADR. I said HADR was one of our diplomacy strategies and that would require competencies and equipment capability, which usually are our naval assets. Our navy is our most important asset in defending our SLOCs. Yet you only need to see the sinking of HMS Repulse and Prince of Wales in WWII to see that air superiority is still of paramount importance especially in waters around us.

I'm not going to go into the doctrine of our SAF, but in order to maintain air superiority it does not only require better aircraft. Ground-based air defence is an important layer as well. If a country's GBAD is capable enough it can deny airspace. F35s would be able to provide SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defences) to generate the airspace superiority for our F15s.

Like I said, Indonesia are getting Rafales and they have also inked an MOU with Boeing for F15EX, a newer/more capable variant of the F15 compared to the F15SG. Whether the procurement comes to fruition is another story, but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. As mentioned, by the time 2030 comes around our F16s are >30 years old so if we do not plan for their replacements now then when should we do so? Do you have any alternative suggestions for our F16 replacement if not the F35?

3. Look, if there is no risk of conflict at all obviously every country would want to prioritise healthcare and other infrastructure.  
[https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/documents/2024/02/17/w6hhgd-240217-budget-2022-in-and-out-revenue-and-expenditure.pdf](https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/documents/2024/02/17/w6hhgd-240217-budget-2022-in-and-out-revenue-and-expenditure.pdf)

We are also spending a lot on healthcare, almost the same as the amount we spend on defence. Obviously your agenda is against spending on defence. It is always difficult justifying spending large on defence if there is no conflict. But there is a real risk of taking defence/security for granted and if we neglect that and if the time comes for us to require that strong defence in a conflict but we didn't have it, it would be too late.

It is just like buying insurance. Nobody rational buys insurance and looks forward to receive claims/payouts from the insurance because that would mean something bad has happened. But just because nothing happens now doesn't mean we don't need insurance too. If we only look for insurance/help when something happens in the future then it is too late.

As I alluded to, the strong defence we have plays a part in providing that stable and secure environment that foreign investors and companies are attracted to so that they will set up shop here, in turn generating jobs for all of us. Corporate income tax is also the government's biggest source of revenue.

1b27mw5,kslpsxy,2/28/2024 22:03,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Hydrogen-fuelled flights in S‚Äôpore could take off in future, but gaps remain: Study  

SINGAPORE - In the 2050s, more than 100 flights departing Changi Airport each day could be powered by hydrogen instead of jet fuel, if estimates from a recently concluded study are anything to go by.

However, as the technology to use liquid hydrogen to power aircraft is currently still under development, there are regulatory and technical hurdles that need to be overcome first, the study flagged.

For instance, while future hydrogen-powered planes flying out of Changi Airport could reach about 74 airports in 20 Asia-Pacific countries and territories, it is vital that these potential destination airports are ready to accommodate such planes.

Airlines must also find it commercially viable to use hydrogen as an alternative fuel source, those behind the study said.

There were more than 164,000 aircraft departures from Changi Airport in 2023, or about 450 each day.

Unlike jet fuel, hydrogen is seen as a cleaner fuel as it does not produce any planet-warming carbon dioxide when burned. But it is more expensive to produce, and there are questions over its safety and viability.

A two-year technical feasibility study looking into these issues was done by airport operator Changi Airport Group (CAG), the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), aircraft-maker Airbus and chemical firm Linde.

The results were released on Feb 22, on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow.

The parties involved in the study also came together in February 2022 to form the Singapore Hydrogen Cooperation Committee.

They said hydrogen is expected to play a future part in the decarbonisation of Singapore‚Äôs aviation industry, and their findings will help prepare Singapore to incorporate liquid hydrogen into its decarbonisation plans when the technology becomes mature.

According to the study, Singapore‚Äôs aviation sector may consume up to 50 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a day to power aircraft from the 2040s, with this potentially climbing to 600 tonnes daily a decade later in a high-demand scenario.

For comparison, Singapore Airlines Group‚Äôs fleet of passenger and cargo planes consumed more than 1.7 billion gallons of fuel in the financial year 2019/2020 before Covid-19 struck ‚Äì or about 14,300 tonnes of jet fuel a day.

CAG, CAAS, Airbus and Linde said the study‚Äôs liquid hydrogen consumption estimates were based on the premise that future hydrogen aircraft with capacities of about 100 to 200 passengers and operating ranges of about 1,000 to 2,000 nautical miles (1,850km to 3,700km) would enter service in Singapore from about 2035 to 2040.

These parameters are similar to the operating specifications for three hydrogen-powered aircraft concepts that Airbus is developing under its ZEROe programme.

The firm is currently studying using either a fuel cell system, which uses hydrogen to create electricity, or engines that burn hydrogen directly. It aims to bring one of its ZEROe aircraft concepts to market by 2035.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Anyone following the news would not need convincing that the world has become a more dangerous place, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said on Feb 28 as he made clear the need for continued investment in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to deter aggression against Singapore.

To keep the SAF strong, the Republic will keep military spending at about 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next decade.

This is barring any conflicts or wars, Dr Ng said during the debate on the Ministry of Defence‚Äôs budget. He announced several updates to the SAF‚Äôs platforms, including that the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) would acquire eight F-35A fighter aircraft to complement the 12 F-35Bs that it previously bought.

In his speech, he noted that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is in its third year, while there are worries that the Israel-Hamas conflict could spread beyond Gaza. A de facto trade war between the US and China has started, and there are worries that both countries could clash over Taiwan, he added.

All this means that he has changed his assessment of the risk of regional and global conflicts from being unlikely to being ‚Äúnon-zero‚Äù, said Dr Ng.

‚ÄúI can assure this House that surprises and unintended consequences are in store ‚Äì some linked, others completely out of the blue,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWhen the ambient temperature of geopolitics rises, sparks and fires will arise from multiple sources.‚Äù

Recounting the 1990 invasion of small and wealthy Kuwait by its neighbour Iraq, Dr Ng noted that the US went to the rescue, leading a 42-country force.

If something similar were to happen here, the Government, Mindef and the SAF do not plan on the basis that another country will come to Singapore‚Äôs rescue, said Dr Ng.

‚ÄúIf Singaporeans will not or cannot defend Singapore, there is no backstop. That is the simple truth,‚Äù he said.

Mindef‚Äôs budget for the coming financial year is projected to be $20.2 billion ‚Äì a 2.5 per cent increase from financial year 2023.

Dr Ng said that while Singapore‚Äôs defence spending has increased nominally in recent years, the share as a percentage of GDP has been falling, mainly due to faster economic growth.

Defence spending has fallen from 5 per cent of GDP two decades ago to 3 per cent today, even as total government spending has risen from 16 per cent to 18 per cent of GDP, he said.

This has been possible without compromising the Republic‚Äôs defence capabilities due to consistent and sustained investment in defence, which is the most effective and efficient means of building a strong military over the long term, added Dr Ng.

Noting that military capabilities need years to mature and produce results, he said Singapore is reaping the dividends of its long-term spending.

For instance, the RSAF began evaluating the F-35 in 2004, before announcing its first purchase of four of the planes in 2019. When the F-35s are delivered from 2026, they will enable the air force to progressively draw down its ageing F-16s while maintaining a capable air force, said Dr Ng.

1b2igl5,kslpqw2,2/28/2024 22:03,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Singapore-registered firm accused of swindling $1.2b from 26,000 people in Japan‚Äôs largest scam  

TOKYO/SINGAPORE ‚Äì A Singapore-registered company that promised its members the high life has come under scrutiny in Japan, where four of its top executives are under arrest on suspicion of swindling 135 billion yen (S$1.2 billion) from 26,000 people.

Sky Premium International is alleged to have masterminded what is Japan‚Äôs largest scam in violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, according to Fukuoka Prefectural Police.

It is said to have acted as an investment advisory firm to peddle a financial product that it called Lion Premium, without the authorisation of Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency.

On Feb 22, Fukuoka Prefectural Police arrested four executives, including Atsushi Saito, 45, who is identified in Japanese media reports as the company‚Äôs chief executive officer, and Shinobu Mizushima, 59, who is said to be the chief sales officer.

The arrests came after police reports were lodged in six prefectures, including Fukuoka, by investors who could not get back their investments. A series of civil lawsuits against Sky Premium are also pending before the courts, including in Hokkaido, Tokyo and Osaka.

Under Japanese law, suspects can be detained for up to 23 days without indictment. The detention period, however, may be prolonged as they may be ‚Äúre-arrested‚Äù on a different charge.

Sky Premium‚Äôs current registered address on the 27th floor of SBF Center in Shenton Way, in the heart of Singapore‚Äôs Central Business District, appeared unoccupied when The Straits Times visited on Feb 27.

The front door was locked and the lights were turned off. From the outside, the office appeared spartan, with a white sign that read ‚ÄúSky Premium‚Äù. There was no doorbell.

Three office workers on the same floor told ST that they had never seen the office being used. One of them had seen people going in and out of the unit only when the company first moved in.

Business records from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority show that Sky Premium International was incorporated in February 2013 and moved to the SBF Center in June 2022. Its director is listed as Mr Tan Albert, a Singapore citizen.

When ST visited his listed home address ‚Äì an HDB flat in Serangoon ‚Äì on Feb 27, a middle-aged man who identified himself as Mr Tan answered the door and acknowledged that he was the director of Sky Premium.

However, he repeatedly told ST that he was unaware of allegations against the company and insisted that queries be directed to his CEO.

Sky Premium is said to have begun operations in Japan in 2013 before launching in Singapore in 2018, when it was billed as the Republic‚Äôs first invitation-only ‚Äúexclusive privileges club‚Äù, according to a report in a luxury publication.

At the time, it charged an annual fee of $1,200, with members receiving a welcome package that included a 1g certified gold ingrained membership card and access to its facilities, which were then on the top floor of One Raffles Place. Since December 2023, the top two levels, 61 and 62, of One Raffles Place have been entirely occupied by nightlife venue HighHouse.

2. He sent me a picture of my food hanging from someone else's door
3. He proceeded to ignore all calls and messages I sent to him

Grab has accepted all my points above. Their own location records have shown that the fella was a long distance away from my house when he 'finished' delivery. Grab gave me a full refund and will take disciplinary action against him with all the facts above considered.

Best case scenario, he bochap and gave my dinner to some random household.

I‚Äôve been getting matches but I can‚Äôt date/ talk to more than 2 people at once. I also don‚Äôt wanna waste the guys and my time.. I‚Äôm not sure if this 2 guys I‚Äôm talking to would be compatible with me, or I should just move on.


So:

Guy A feels like a very chill and good friend to me. He‚Äôs attractive and we vibe but I don‚Äôt feel like I want to jump his bones. Seems very interested in getting to know me, based on the frequency he has asked me out and the personal questions he has asked. He seems eager to take things to the next level so I feel like I should decide how I feel about him instead of wasting his time. 

Guy B is cute and shy so he pulls at my heart strings. I think we have a lot of sexual chemistry, so I can tease him the way I can‚Äôt do with guy B. But he‚Äôs a very busy and low maintenance person, so we only talk on the weekends when he doesn‚Äôt have work. This means that we can‚Äôt get to know each other quickly, and that it‚Äôll literally take forever for me to get to know him (since we rarely text and only meet up). 


I know in terms of emotional/physical availability guy A would be a better choice. Yet I feel that since I don‚Äôt feel chemistry/ sexual attraction towards guy A then I should just drop him, lest he get more invested in me. I also know that chemistry isn‚Äôt everything, and that finding an ideal partner who can communicate & respect me is important. 
I also feel that dating guy B will take like eons‚Ä¶. And I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth wasting so much of my time just to get to know someone

Maybe I am clueless & no matter how I try, I can‚Äôt seem to sell. I don‚Äôt have the gift of gab & no matter how I try to learn the art of it, I simply can‚Äôt seem to do it.

Why do I still try & share about products that may help my friends or people who have problems that these products can help, even though I know ultimately they‚Äôll just be silent on me after I shared the benefits & all the testimonials? Because I genuinely thought & hope it will help them just like it helped me.

Hair loss, skin problems especially baby/toddler/children related skin problems. These are close to my heart & those I am in frequent online contact with.

Sometimes I feel like a loser. Lots of times actually. Every time actually.

Maybe I am too factual of a person?
Idk. I just feel depressed at times.

I have stopped sharing but my heart sometimes breaks whenever I see the same questions popping up on ‚Äúhow to help my child skin problems‚Äù or ‚Äúhow do you deal with post partum hair loss‚Äù kind questions which is frequent on my multiple social media feeds.

Currently not having the extra bandwidth to actually level up or whatever the term is (mom brained got my brain forgetful), so I am just venting anonymously here because I don‚Äôt want pity sales from people around me or make them annoyed with me whining away at my lack of sales.

Doing these kind of sales because at the moment I have very limited options to do full/part time job & basically stuck to being a stay at home parent while juggling multiple children‚Äôs schedules etc on my lonesomely alone while the spouse is basically off to work most of the time. Doing my best to get my own little income because do not want to depend on spouse‚Äôs income, and spouse also always tells me income not enough even when I request a little more amount for kids/house expenses. Also want income for myself to at least be able to top up my ezlink & do the little basic stuffs for myself like how I used to when I was a full time working parent or even when I was a part time working parent years ago. Really doing my best to also do other things to supplement my almost non existent income, but it‚Äôs tough. üò≠

I am male, 22, and have been residing in Singapore for the past 12 years. I went through primary, secondary, and poly, and am currently in uni (top 3) with a scholarship. My family and I (a total of 3 people) applied for PR together a total of 3 times but, unfortunately, were rejected for all of them.

However, I decided to apply for PR alone when I just started university, and recently, I received a letter from ICA on whether I am willing to continue with this PR application and that I will be liable for NS, to which I said yes without having a doubt about it.

You can successfully port into GIGA today, fully, and port out tomorrow and the number transfer should be successful.

I checked their T&C and could find no mention of such clause:

> (ii) your giga! mobile line has no pending/outstanding charges.

For example : Friday 6:15 PM @ Pub at some place, booked under my name. I will start drinking at 6:20 PM. If nobody come, I will drink until satisfied and leave by 7:00 PM. If the activities is like BBQ, then ECP pit xx, 4:30 to 8:00. If you are late bring your own beer and food. We won't wait anyone and we won't reserve any beer or BBQ.

Next time don't put yourself in this kind of ""I waited for 1.5 hr"". Give 15\~25 minutes and do whatever activity your own or cancel it.

1b2lfqt,kso2ur4,2/29/2024 8:18,SomeRandomSomeWhere,"I understand over 300,000 tickets have been sold for the concert. Let's say 100,000 were bought by Singapore residents and 200,000 from people outside Singapore.

Many of them will stay for more then one day. That means hotel rooms, food, local transport, etc. And some of them will visit other parts of Singapore (hey, am already here, I may as well spend a few days, visit the zoo, spend a day at sentosa, etc). Not to mention air flights, etc.

And some who are already scheduled for visits to Singapore around concert time will come earlier/leave later to catch the concert as well while they are already here.

Let's say each of the 200,000 concert goers who are visiting Singapore only spends an average of 1000 dollars. That's 200,000,000 dollars direct injection into Singapore economy. I suspect my figure is way lower then actual.

Those are just the direct benefits to Singapore's economy. Indirect benefit is Singapore often being associated with big events. F1, Coldplay, Taylor swift, etc. That helps to increase the profile of the country internationally and if the event goes well, it adds a positive vibe to Singapore internationally.

Dyson is the most famous example I can think of - he came for F1, liked what he saw in Singapore, and decided to shift some of his business to Singapore. Now think of all the other less famous business owners/executives who are also visiting and how many of them will want to start something/shift some business to Singapore. Or want to shift themselves and settle down here themselves.

So even if Singapore government spends 10 million on getting Taylor swift concert to perform exclusively, Singapore will have lots of direct and indirect benefits - especially if the event goes off without a hitch.",Philippine lawmaker wants probe on Taylor Swift‚Äôs Singapore-only concert deal ‚Äî ‚Äònot what good neighbours do‚Äô,508,0.92,2/29/2024,0

That is their race"", which is congruent with our government's interpretation of the One China policy (that PRC is the sole representative of China, and that the Taiwan question is a matter that the Chinese from both sides of the Strait must resolve by themselves), though if you ask any Filipino, they will say that Taiwan and China are different ""countries"", and a few would be aware of the Chinese Civil War and the its implications today. Of course it's more pronounced in the Chinese Filipino community, some of which were directly impacted by the said war (ie. their ancestors migrated to here due to the war) and thus might have a spirited opinion on the matter. 

For context, the province of [Cagayan](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cagayan) is in the northeastern part of Luzon Island, which includes the Babuyan Islands, which, together with the province of Batanes, are the closest to Taiwan Island.

1b2m4tj,ksmm7m4,2/29/2024 1:17,_sagittarivs,"Yups, when fear is used, people tend to fear the punishment rather than to understand where their actions could have affected others. 

For example, say, the punishment for assaulting others is a jail term (I'm not sure if it's the actual punishment, but just using as an example.). 

The thing holding us back from assaulting people is the fear of being jailed. But the actual reasoning for not assaulting people is that it causes harm to them. 

Well yes, you can say that it brings about the same outcome of preventing people from assaulting others, it only differs by the process people understand it. And yes, you can say the law can explain the reasoning and it's easy to see. 

But when you look back into the reality, there'll be some people who say things like ""eh don't go and hit people, if hit people, police come catch you and you go jail"". 

When we look back into how we were parented, when we get scolded (eg. for playing with water), the key to helping us understand is how our parents told us about why we get scolded. Some parents leave it at ""stop doing this, it's wrong!"" Some parents go the extra mile and say ""can you stop doing this? I know it's fun to play but water is not free, etc.""

The difference between the first example and second example of how parents can choose to talk to us when we get scolded, is the provision of reasoning, and helping kids to understand why certain actions are not as desirable. Without providing the reason, the basis of doing things in a certain way is just due to fear itself; fear of getting punished, fear of consequences.","Parents with self-control, who don't use harsh punishments tend to have emotionally resilient kids: NUS study",342,0.95,2/29/2024,0

Most Singaporeans are firmly in middle class - and that's the bunch of people who aren't having kids. I highly doubt it's because of money. The average monthly income of the resident-employed middle class household in Singapore according to SingStat is S$10,869 in 2023. That means money isn't a (huge) issue, as long as you're spending on reasonable items (what's ""reasonable"" is a separate conversation to have).

I argue that it's time. Take the average SGean married person: 7 hours of sleep, 8-9 hours of work, 1.5-2 hours total commuting time, 1-2 hours for R&R = minimum of 17 hours in a day gone. Say you try to keep fit (more so if you're male since IPPT) so you exercise 1 hour. Factor in travelling time if you go to a gym, and that's probably 2 hours back and forth. 5 hours left.

In these 5 hours, you have to add in miscellaneous stuff like grocery shopping, cooking/washing up, laundry, cleaning the house etc. Honestly, even after you spread these chores out, what time do you have left for your kid?

I'm not even sure people HAVE time to make children. Or find a partner at all.

Best solution? Cut working hours (4 day work week, 9 hours a day?) legislate and enforce the right to disconnect, change mindsets about promotion = success, and mandate minimum pay increments to match inflation. I can't consider having a kid if I'm trying to get a leg up on everyone else.

I understand these are systemic changes that must occur but are unlikely to do so because Singapore wants to remain so ""business friendly"". Fact is that every business sees people as resources and will exploit them as much as possible. 

So till the government sees us as actual human beings rather than resources, throwing baby bonuses at us or conversations about where I try to make babies isn't gonna make a damn difference.",Help gahmen to think of ways to increase TFR,0,0.39,2/29/2024,0
1b2opz2,ksn4jzk,2/29/2024 3:12,Familiar-Necessary49,"I am sure cost of living and cost of raising a child is a factor in determining having a kid. However i do not think it is the main reason. I tested this hypothesis against the 60s and 80s. While COL is admittedly lower, most of our parents(Some even grandparents) are not as well off as couples now. So IMO if we were to adopt solution(what the gov have been doing for the last 2 decades) based on high COL we will only see limited increase in TFR. In order to solve the TFR problem we first must ask ourselves ""what changed?"" 

In my non academic and andecotal opinion, i think what changed the most is people's aspiration. In the past, our parents idea of a  good life are argueably much simpler. Enough to eat, place to sleep, yearly holidays etc. However, these definition of ""good life"" is not longer enough. Now both couples are more career driven often lowering the pirorities of settling down for career advancement.

1b2opz2,ksndrk1,2/29/2024 4:17,endlessftw,"A solution needs to be multi-pronged and comprehensive.

Having children is a life pursuit. In a developed country, this isn‚Äôt the only life pursuit. There are many alternatives and competition. What makes having children attractive compared to others?

As a life pursuit, it is also gated by practicality. How much resources can two individual invest in that goal? If they do not have adequate personal time, energy and financial backing, then chances are, most people wouldn‚Äôt be attracted to pursue such goals.

To make having children practical, we likely need:

1. Good work life balance to give people personal time and energy. Eg, 4 days work week, 36-40h work weeks, embracing WFH at the expense of the commercial real estate sector, efficient and quick public transport connectivity.

2. Moderate cost of living and prices of big ticket items, boost wages sustainably at the low to mid level, tax reliefs to parents, to increase disposable income available to consider childrearing.

3. Strong and cheap childcare infrastructure to support working parents. You want to make childrearing easier, not harder.

4. Housing needs to be readily available. Scrap BTO system since the government is tightly controlling supply anyway. Not short waiting time, I mean no waiting time! I mean the walk in get the keys kind! If 100% of BTO projects are built, then what‚Äôs the purpose of BTO? All it does is add years of waiting to absolve the govt of some *unlikely* financial responsibility.

There is also the need to make family formation attractive to other goals, such as career or leisure:

1. Singapore must embrace that any life goal is socially acceptable, and pushing SG to be less materialistic. You want family forming to be as acceptable as pursuing strong work career. Think of a certain ethnicity with a culture of putting more emphasis on family life.

2. We must somehow allow singles to mix well with other singles and yet avoid the pitfall of some aspects of online dating, such as toxic dating culture where material possessions and physical traits are too highly emphasised. If the culture drives people to pursue career or things like that just to be attractive to potential mates, eventually when they settle down, it‚Äôs not going to just suddenly change gears. Also, the mismatch (too high expectations on potential mates vs reality) would reduce the number of pairing, which is obviously the critical prerequiste to having babies.

3. Having children needs to be seen as meaningful. After all, what‚Äôs the point of life if not to live a happy and meaningful one? We shouldn‚Äôt make having children too stressful, and we need to make it easier for children to achieve outcomes that brings joy to parents. Need to move away from being materialistic and too traditional, which can cause parents to get stressed when kids don‚Äôt get into good schs or get good grades, earn big bucks, etc. If people think giving birth to children would just burden them with a horrible life like we have now, and having children is not meaningful, then people aren‚Äôt going to give birth and have kids!

long answer: still time and money, and maybe a little bit of selfishness.

as a millenial who grew up in the system and is somewhat in the age range that shld be contributing to the TFR, there are not enough attractive incentives for me to want to make babies. 

money: if both of us work full time, need to spend the money on childcare/helper to help look after your kid, and that comes with a whole other load of concerns/problems on the upbringing of your kid. send to childcare they fall sick easily, need to take CCL, which is also limited. need to spend money on enrichment classes cos of the kiasu parent mentality, want to give the best to yr kid and dont want them to lose out to their peers also. need to make sure got enough savings to send them to uni (local or even overseas) also, cos nowadays no degree so little doors of opportunities open to them. with current day-to-day living, i save maybe 50% of my income. add on additional mouths to feed and cloth and to bring up, i save at most 10-20% only. which also means i need to work longer years before i can retire. 

time: come back from work, tired, need to do the cooking and household chores, very limited time to teach or even interact with the kids before their bedtime. weekends are packed with ferrying them to and from and between classes. how to inculcate or impart them with the values you want them to have? barely any me time left to decompress or spend w yr partner, or exercise (and they talk so much about health and mental health), and the cycle repeats when the new week starts.

The stress if your boss needs you to stay late to finish work, and you're in between a rock and a hard place, maybe desperately phoning your mother/MIL to ask them to go pick up, I will pay for the Grab etc. 

And it's no use asking childcares to stay open later, because ideally small children should go to sleep by 8 - 8.30 pm. And you still need to feed them dinner after childcare. Instead we see a lot of chronically sleep-deprived children even before they start primary school, with parents dropping off fast asleep children still in pajamas at childcares. 

9 - 5 (or 8.30 - 5) for 5 days a week would be much better than 4 x 10. You don't need a whole extra day to go kai kai with the kid, and most likely you have already paid for childcare for Mon-Fri.

Everyone says women's education is the reason for falling birthrates. A key factor is opportunity cost. If the taxes are by % it reflects the opportunity cost of the high flying woman who will try her best to have kids to balance that cost.

Low income people even if you give them more tax benefit, the amount is too small compared to the monthly expense. It won't sway their decision at all to have kids. I don't even pay attention to tax when my income was low because it was negligible in the grand scheme of things. Especially when it is not a rebate but a deduction of CI.

High income mothers can afford to have more kids and if you sweeten the deal, they will have the kids, unless they hate kids (and in that case you are still getting the full taxes from their income). Richer people can afford and tend to have more kids since they can afford. Wmcr makes their disposable income even higher which improves affordability even further.

On caregiving, my personal take is that this needs to change drastically. Currently, parents are changing their lives to fit childcare hours - take leave when childcare close/must end work by 6.30pm to make it for 7pm closing/take unpaid leave to fully care for kids 

This is bad for the country and organisation (loss in productivity, low childbirth), parents (no more freedom, just more problems so might as well don‚Äôt have kids), kids (don‚Äôt spend time with parents as often). 

Most importantly, the current singapore structure requires parents to give up ourselves (personal time, work time and aspirations, money). This is compensated by monetary rewards and some additional leave by the government. There is mismatch is what we want and what govt is giving. 

Why do we have to lose ourselves JUST to have kids? When you ask yourself do i love myself or love children more? Of course, the answer is we love ourselves more. You may say, people who don‚Äôt love kids enough should not have kids. Yes yes, but to be very honest, most people who love kids don‚Äôt know they love kids so much until they have their own kids. Also, people can love playing with kids but not so much the taking care. 

So govt should make it look like ‚Äúyour life don‚Äôt have to change just because you have kids‚Äù 

- offer wider range of child caring services (can we have/normalise adhoc childcare services? overnight even?)
- introduce mandatory/default flexible working arrangements for new parents to adjust to their new lives (people do want to continue contributing meaningfully at work while having kids) 

But instead, right now govt is saying ‚Äúi know it‚Äôs tough having kids. but hey look, here‚Äôs some baby bonus to make you feel better‚Äù.",Help gahmen to think of ways to increase TFR,0,0.39,3/1/2024,0

The reason being that I was an early reader, had gone to the reading corner and started reading to my classmates. The teacher didn't like that I was ""showing off"".

My mom raised a stink with the principal but this was in the days before the Internet even existed, so it was never made public and my parents just moved me to another school.

I was so young I don't even remember that incident. But I remember having an irrational fear of teachers and other authority figures in Primary school. Even when they were not angry and asking me simple questions, I just froze and didn't answer them. That made them think I was ignoring them or being rude, which resulted in more scolding/punishment and made things worse.

I only started being able to talk to teachers in secondary school and even then I was never comfortable even asking questions. All this affected my performance quite a bit.

It only made sense years later when I was having a convo with my mom about some other pre-school abuse case and she told me the story. She also mentioned that as a child I was very confident talking to adults and that changed after the incident.

So what they did was to buy out or set up many preschool and day cares. Because you just need to hire people with not much credentials as at that time the barrier to entry was low

Since now there are investors and specifically much more profit driven, investors pressure preschool managers to maximise profits by hiring cheaper labour and skimping on costs, such as reducing the teacher to student ratio

ECDA and ministry has been clamping down and pushing guidelines to this preschool, but as you can see enforcement has been terrible

Another problem is Government can't do too stringent policies as well. There is a huge shortage of preschool and infant cares as well as early childhood teachers. If they start shutting these poorly managed centres, double income parents will be stuck with 0 options. This is the result of government pushing for double income (which is not wrong) 

So now, policy makers and parents are stuck between a rock and a hard place. You will notice that parents have only been slowly pulling kids out of the affected centres, because there really isn't enough. (and the fines are a joke considering what they re making)

In my view there is only a few plausible solution

1) mandate more flexible working arrangement and pro employee policies. (not guidelines) 

Stuff like employers get tax rebates for giving employees flexible work arrangement or wfh 

These could shorten the hours the kids need to be at infant care. Changing the need for full day infant care to half day, effectively doubling the size. 

Right now subsidies are pushing for full time work and not half day. 

2) do what our government likes to do best, forcifully unprivatise childcares and infant cares and raise wages. 

Right now most childcares are privately owned and are just ECDA partners. Dedicate a part of public funds to do so, and since this is known to be a profitable business, this might even generate tax revenues. 

Yea but subsidies are paid by government as well - well better than going to these shady investors profits","Boy, 3, allegedly locked in dark room, shouted at by pre-school teachers; police investigating",323,0.97,2/29/2024,0

SINGAPORE ‚Äì A National University of Singapore (NUS) assistant professor has been charged with cannabis consumption and other drug-related offences.

Jevdic Dorde, 39, who is from the School of Computing‚Äôs Department of Computer Science, is accused of one count each of drug consumption and possession of a vape device containing a cannabinol derivative.

The Serbian was also charged on Feb 27 with one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, including four straws and a rubber tube.

In a statement to The Straits Times on Feb 28, NUS said that Dorde has been suspended from work since August 2023 and will be subject to its internal disciplinary processes pending court proceedings.

‚ÄúAll NUS staff are expected to hold themselves up to high standards of professional and personal conduct, including abiding by the laws and regulations of Singapore,‚Äù a university spokesperson added.

According to court documents, Dorde allegedly consumed cannabis on or before Aug 4, 2023.

He allegedly had the vape device and drug paraphernalia in a unit at Kent Vale serviced residence in Clementi Road.

NUS states on its website that Kent Vale offers fully-furnished apartments for its guests and visitors.

Dorde‚Äôs case has been adjourned to March 26.

For drug consumption, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $20,000.

The Doctors who actually do the studies, though, do know what they're talking about. Which is more than I can say for some.

This has been common knowledge for over a decade and was the driving force from getting away from all those scare tactics, barbaric prison terms and outdated attitudes. These studies, in turn, led to many countries legalising weed.

You should really keep up with the studies. It isn't 1965 anymore.

I quote...

""The World Health Organization estimates that risks linked to alcohol cause 2.5 million deaths a year from heart and liver disease, road accidents, suicides and cancer -- accounting for 3.8 percent of all deaths. It is the third leading risk factor for premature death and disabilities worldwide.""

""Using a technique called multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) which assessed damage according to nine criteria on harm to the user and seven criteria on harm to others.
Harms to the user included things such as drug-specific or drug-related death, damage to health, drug dependence and loss of relationships, while harms to others included crime, environmental damage, family conflict, international damage, economic cost, and damage to community cohesion.""

""Drugs were then scored out of 100, with 100 given to the most harmful drug and zero indicating no harm at all.

The scientists found alcohol was most harmful, with a score of 72, followed by heroin with 55 and crack with 54.

Among some of the other drugs assessed were crystal meth (33), cocaine (27), tobacco (26), amphetamine or speed (23), cannabis (20), benzodiazepines, such as Valium (15), ketamine (15), methadone (14), mephedrone (13), ecstasy (9), anabolic steroids (9), LSD (7) and magic mushrooms (5).""

In terms of harm to society, yes. Alcohol has a far bigger impact due to its availability and societal acceptance. 

Heroin by contrast is illegal, shunned by society and far more difficult to procure. Of course by comparison the total impact is lower than alcohol.

Had you bothered, then you would see that your assumptions in your reply, weighted for users, populations etc. Are all answered in said peer reviewed papers.

I would say 'Happy reading"" but I'm certain you won't bother. Ignorance is difficult to cure, especially among drinkers and alcoholics who have never worked in prisons, with the police, social services or hospitals,  where the damage from alcohol is witnessed at endemic levels.

1b2rnfd,ksngfen,2/29/2024 4:37,SG_wormsbot,"Title: New ServiceSG centres to be set up in Woodlands and Bukit Merah by end-2024  

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Two new ServiceSG centres will be set up in Woodlands and Bukit Merah by end-2024, making it more convenient for citizens to apply for government services within their neighbourhoods.

These are in addition to the seven existing centres that have been set up since 2021, said Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing on Feb 29.

The two new centres will be set up at Woodlands Civic Centre and Bukit Merah Town Central.

Replying to a question in Parliament from Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), Mr Chan said these centres have expanded their service offerings and partnerships with more than 25 government agencies and now provide almost 600 services.

These include helping citizens top up their Central Provident Fund accounts, file taxes, and renew passports.

He added that the Government will continue to expand the network of centres to prioritise areas with higher demand and a higher concentration of seniors, particularly those who need help with multiple digital transactions.

‚ÄúThe public service is committed to ensuring that overnment services continue to be accessible and inclusive for all as more government services digitalise,‚Äù said Mr Chan.

He also said the Government would do its best to increase the number of multilingual service ambassadors at these centres.

The existing ServiceSG centres are located at One Punggol, Our Tampines Hub, Bukit Canberra, The Frontier Community Club, Keat Hong Community Club, Nee Soon Central Community Club, and Kampong Chai Chee Community Club.

Mr Yip had also asked if ministries and agencies could set aside physical counters for senior citizens who need help with public services.

In response, Mr Chan said agencies with physical service centres currently offer in-person assistance primarily by appointment only.

This allows citizens to schedule visits at their convenience for transactions that cannot be completed online, reducing the frustration of long queues or wait times, he added.

However, the agencies do exercise discretion in assisting less digitally savvy and vulnerable individuals who walk in without making appointments, said Mr Chan.

Trained service ambassadors are also present at these service centres to help this group, Mr Chan said, adding that seniors can also go to ServiceSG centres where no prior appointment is needed.

1b2uovy,ksnz3tw,2/29/2024 7:34,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Suspended lawyer M. Ravi charged with 5 counts of assault, 6 counts of harassment  

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Suspended lawyer Ravi Madasamy, better known as M. Ravi, who is accused of multiple offences including assault has been handed 13 more charges.

On Feb 29, he was charged with six counts of harassment and five counts of assault.

Ravi, 54, was also charged with one count each of using criminal force on another person and committing an act of public nuisance.

His latest charges allegedly involve seven men and two women.

He now faces 19 charges in total, including those he received in 2023.

Ravi was at the office of law firm KK Cheng Law at High Street Centre on Nov 22, 2021, when he allegedly threw a remote control at a man that hit him in the right wrist.

Ravi is also accused of assaulting a second man at the law firm on the same day by acts such as pushing the latter‚Äôs chest and grabbing his shirt, as well as throwing a perfume bottle, which hit the man‚Äôs right shin.

According to court documents, Ravi also allegedly verbally insulted the second man.

Court documents did not disclose what spurred him to allegedly act in such a manner at the law firm or in any of the other incidents over which he is facing charges.

In another incident, Ravi was at the carpark of Leville iSuites condominium in Ceylon Road on Dec 21, 2021, at around 9pm, when he allegedly hurled obscenities at a third man.

On Jan 22, 2022, Ravi was at a shop in Joo Chiat Road when he allegedly hurled vulgarities at a woman.

On Feb 11, 2022, he is said to have slapped a fourth man‚Äôs left cheek, causing some bruising, at a book store in Upper Cross Street. Ravi is also accused of abusing him with vulgar language.

Ravi is accused of hurling vulgarities at a fifth man and shoving a sixth man at the Sri Mariamman Temple in South Bridge Road on July 9, 2023.

Ravi is also said to have committed an act of public nuisance by flipping a table at the place of worship that day.

Two days later, he was outside a restaurant in South Bridge Road when he allegedly abused a seventh man with vulgar language and told him to ‚Äúreturn to India and Pakistan‚Äù.

Ravi is also accused of pushing a second woman outside the same eatery on that day. She suffered a laceration to the back of her head when she fell.

Ravi‚Äôs case has been adjourned to March 4.

In March 2023, he was suspended from practice for the maximum of five years for making ‚Äúbaseless and grave‚Äù allegations that undermine the integrity of Singapore‚Äôs justice system against the Attorney-General, prosecutors and the Law Society.

The misconduct arose from comments that he made to socio-political website The Online Citizen, as well as comments he posted on Facebook after the Court of Appeal reversed his client‚Äôs death sentence in 2020.

If convicted of assault, Ravi can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000 for each charge.

For each count of harassment, an offender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $5,000.

In liquidation the liquidators will realise whatever assets they can and distribute them in order of priority/security. 

Secured creditors with securities such as mortgages etc will be the highest rank, then priority creditors such as employees, IRAS etc. 

Only if there are leftover assets after distributing to the priority creditors do the ordinary creditors get anything. Usually by this stage it‚Äôs very negligible returns, if for eg you get 5-10% of your money back you can laugh already.

1b2xfwm,ksq5fqs,2/29/2024 17:52,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Fully subsidised tuition fees for over 3,000 NTU undergraduates in new academic year  

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Undergraduates from the neediest households ‚Äì those with per capita income of up to $1,100 ‚Äì will not have to pay tuition fees at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in the new academic year.

NTU will top up existing government bursaries to fully subsidise tuition fees for these students from August 2024, the university said on Feb 2.

More than 3,000 undergraduates are expected to benefit from this enhanced financial aid scheme, which adds to the range of financial assistance schemes that help ease educational and living expenses of students from low-income families.

NTU president Ho Teck Hua said: ‚ÄúWe want to ensure that every student, regardless of financial background, has access to the rich and well-rounded university experience that NTU offers.‚Äù

Currently, bursary holders have at least 54 per cent of their tuition fees subsidised, NTU said.

These students, if they qualify, can offset the balance of their tuition fees through additional scholarships and bursaries.

They will be required to apply every year for the financial aid, subject to approval from the financial aid office.

NTU is ramping up fund-raising efforts to build an endowment fund to ensure that its neediest students will continue to enjoy full coverage of their tuition fees.

‚ÄúWe are committed to doing all that we can to give students who are most in need of support a fair shot at achieving their full potential,‚Äù said Professor Ho.

In 2022, the National University of Singapore (NUS) announced a similar scheme, where its full-time Singapore undergraduates do not need to pay tuition fees if they come from homes with per capita income of up to $1,000. Those in general courses such as the humanities and sciences receive an additional $2,300 to $7,000 a year in financial aid.

Mr Ng Tze Kean and his younger sister, both in the penultimate year of their course at NTU, said that having financial support eased their worries, allowing them to pursue internships in their fields of study.

Mr Ng, 24, said that the Covid-19 pandemic was a hard time for their father, who struggled with changes in his job and the death of the siblings‚Äô paternal grandmother.

Their father currently does freelance work repairing electronic items, while their mother is a housewife.

1b2xksu,ksq5erk,2/29/2024 17:52,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Sun Xueling calls out Meta for not working with MHA to fight e-commerce scams on its platforms  

SINGAPORE - While various online platforms have cooperated with the authorities to combat scams, Meta was called out for repeatedly refusing to have safeguards on its platforms to tackle the scourge.

At the debate on the Ministry of Home Affairs‚Äô (MHA) budget on Feb 29, Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling said Facebook Marketplace, which Meta runs, is the only platform among those rated in the ministry‚Äôs anti-scam safety ratings that has not implemented the recommended safety features.

Ms Sun said: ‚ÄúMeta has consistently pushed back against MHA‚Äôs recommendations for them to put in place safeguards to combat e-commerce scams on Facebook, such as verifying users against government-issued ID and offering a secured payment option for Marketplace users.‚Äù

She said Meta products, namely Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, were among the top online platforms exploited by scammers.

These platforms accounted for almost half of the scam cases in 2023, amounting to around $280 million in losses.

According to annual scam figures released by the police earlier in February, the total number of scam cases here hit a record high in 2023, with 46,563 cases reported.

Victims in Singapore lost $651.8 million in 2023, a slight dip from the $660.7 million lost to scammers in 2022. More than $2.3 billion has been lost to scams here since 2019.

E-commerce scams were the second scam of concern in 2023, as the number of cases more than doubled, with 9,783 cases, up from around 4,700 in 2022.

Victims lost at least $13.9 million to e-commerce scams in 2023.

Despite Facebook contributing close to half of the e-commerce scam cases in 2023, Meta has not put in place the recommended safety features to protect their users from falling for scams, said Ms Sun.

She said that in 2023, Facebook Marketplace was ranked the lowest in MHA‚Äôs E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings for the second consecutive year.

The rating system was launched in 2022 to educate consumers on which e-commerce marketplaces have safety features in place to protect users from scams.

Ms Sun said: ‚ÄúI urge Meta to step up, to do right by your users.‚Äù

She was responding to questions from Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio GRC) on how the Government works with online platforms to better protect Singaporeans from scams.

She said other platforms, including Shopee and Carousell, have worked with MHA and the police to strengthen their user verification processes.

She said Shopee has been verifying seller identities against government records, resulting in a 71 per cent drop in e-commerce scams reported on the shopping platform between 2021 and 2023.

SINGAPORE ‚Äî A one-stop portal for all scam-related resources will be launched as the Government studies further measures to better protect unwitting members of the public, including those who refuse to believe that they are being duped.

Announcing the latest measures to combat scams on Thursday (Feb 29), Ms Sun Xueling, Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling, said that the Government cannot fight the battle alone and would need to count on the cooperation of industry stakeholders.

This would include technology companies, which own digital channels and platforms that are being exploited by scammers.

Yet some of these companies such as Meta ‚Äî which own Facebook and Instagram that are among the most exploited ‚Äî are refusing to cooperate and have ""consistently pushed back"" against the recommendations of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

Noting that Facebook contributed close to half of e-commerce scam cases last year, Ms Sun said: ‚ÄúI urge Meta to step up and do right by your users.‚Äù

‚ÄòOLD-FASHIONED FRAUD‚Äô DRIVING SCAM NUMBERS

Ms Sun‚Äôs announcement during a parliamentary debate on MHA's ministry‚Äôs budget came as scams continue to be a concern globally, including in Singapore.

In Australia, losses due to scams shot up 80 per cent in from 2021 to 2022.

In the United States, the losses jumped 72 per cent between 2021 and 2023.

Here, the number of scams and cybercrime cases soared by 49.6 per cent to 50,376 last year.

‚ÄúThe increase in scam numbers was largely driven by scams using social engineering and deception to manipulate victims into transferring monies,‚Äù Ms Sun said, noting that such cases account for 92 per cent of scam losses in 2023.

Examples included job scams, e-commerce or fake friend call scams, where victims believe in the offers promoted to them or were convinced that the person on the other end of the line is a friend.

‚ÄúSuch scams rely more on social engineering rather than technological sophistication. In fact, one could say this is old-fashioned fraud conducted through online means,‚Äù Ms Sun added.

Thus, public education continues to be a key pillar in the fight against scams, so that people may remain vigilant and discerning.

HELPING VICTIMS IN DENIAL

To tackle this problem, the Government plans to enhance public education efforts by setting up a one-stop portal that consolidates anti-scam resources to make such information more easily accessible.

Set to be launched later this year, the site will advise people on what to do if they think they have been cheated, how to protect themselves from getting tricked in the first place and to be alert to the latest types of scams that emerge.

‚ÄúIt will also provide information for victims of scams on where to seek support,‚Äù Ms Sun said.

As for the segment of people who refuse to believe that they have fallen prey to a scam, Ms Sun said: ‚ÄúThey could be victims of love scams or investment scams where they have invested affection or significant amounts of money, making it difficult for them to extract themselves from the situation.‚Äù

Job scams (9,900 cases), investment scams (4,000) and internet love scams (900) are among the top 10 scams in 2023, out of almost 43,000 scams.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì The Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) is looking into a cat cafe in Geylang that has been operating without an animal exhibition licence.

This was discovered when most of its cats were rehomed after a video accusing the cafe of animal abuse went viral online, prompting checks by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).

When contacted on Feb 26, SPCA said it had already received several reports on the neglect of cats at I Love Cat Cafe.

It also observed ‚Äúconcerning signs of compromised welfare‚Äù when it visited the premises that day, and said more than half of the seven cats present looked malnourished.

Five cats were allowed to roam the space, while the remaining two shared a single cage. The cage did not have a water source inside and the litter box was soiled.

SPCA said that the resources inside the free-roaming space were inadequate as the five cats shared three litter boxes and only one water bowl. The cat tree was also unstable, while the cat tunnels were dirty and covered with fur.

The organisation added that ventilation was limited to just one fan, with no openings for airflow when the cafe closed each day.

SPCA considers neglect, which is a failure to meet animals‚Äô basic needs, a breach of animal welfare standards.

After speaking with the management of the cafe, SPCA, alongside an independent rescuer, made a joint second visit to the cafe on Feb 27.

Six of the cats were taken in by the rescuer, including two that were identified to be in poorer health and in need of immediate veterinary attention.

SPCA tasked the cafe owner to rehome the remaining cat. The owner, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, told The Straits Times on Feb 28 that the cat had already been rehomed.

He also explained that the cafe ‚Äì which has been open for about six months ‚Äì was founded with the intention of rehoming the cats. Mr Tan had taken in the cats from people who had previously given them up and encouraged customers to adopt them.

However, he soon realised he did not have the manpower or expertise to run such an operation. He said that he has been planning to expedite the rehoming of the cats and close the shop, for at least three months.

Mr Tan said: ‚ÄúWe are thankful for help in rehoming all the cats.

‚ÄúFrom this episode, I realised that sometimes we don‚Äôt know the extent of responsibility that comes along with taking care of and rehoming cats.‚Äù

The alleged neglect was first highlighted in a video posted to TikTok by user @zigzagzooey on Feb 23. The video, which contained several clips of the cats in the cafe, noted that many of the cats seemed thin and depressed.

The cafe space also seemed dirty with insects crawling around. The video has since amassed over 60,300 views.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì At least 15 complaints have been made against the Singapore Sky Lantern Festival‚Äôs organiser after it refused to refund attendees for the lift-off that never happened.

This comes after hundreds of ticket holders made their way to Sentosa for the festival on Feb 21, only to learn upon arrival that there was no food, nor lanterns taking off that night ‚Äì both of which had been promised.

Days later, a representative of event organiser Asian Couture and Boutique said on Facebook that unhappy attendees can either resell their tickets, which cost about $50 each, or attend a rescheduled release on another day.

Ms Shiermie Bautista, who founded the firm, said in a Facebook post on Feb 27 that ticket holders can attend the rescheduled event around the first week of April.

She added: ‚ÄúFor those who can‚Äôt attend the next event, you can resell your tickets at (ticketing platform) TicketSwap.‚Äù

However, Asian Couture and Boutique‚Äôs director Steven Lau said on Feb 29 that a final decision on the event organiser‚Äôs next steps has yet to be made, and the firm is still collecting feedback from its customers.

There are also question marks over the rescheduled event, with the authorities telling The Straits Times the same day that there has been no information on its date or venue.

A Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) spokesperson said it is still following up with the organiser on the details and the implementation of the fire safety guidelines, and has yet to give any clearance for the rescheduled event.

Previously, SCDF had not allowed the organiser to release sky lanterns, after a site inspection on the day of the festival showed that fire safety guidelines had not been adhered to.

The SCDF spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThey did not provide proper tethers for the sky lanterns, nor fire extinguishers, or safety marshals.

‚ÄúTherefore, in the interest of public and aviation safety, SCDF informed the event organiser that they should not use the sky lanterns for the event.

Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore‚Äôs director for airspace policy Jean Yee said the authority was aware of the intent to reschedule the event, but as at Feb 28, no details on the date, venue and how the event will be executed have been shared.

More than 2,000 people had turned up for the festival on Feb 21, according to Mr Lau.

Some disappointed ticket holders, like first-year university student Tan Jun Wei, 23, simply want their money back.

The 23-year-old said he no longer trusts the organisers due to their unprofessional behaviour.

He said: ‚ÄúEven though they had our contact information, they didn‚Äôt inform us about the delay to the lift-off until we got there... They basically left us in the dark.‚Äù

Mr Tan had forked out more than $100 for two tickets, hoping the event would be a key part of a Valentine‚Äôs Day surprise for his girlfriend, who is a fan of the iconic scene from the Disney film Tangled, where the protagonists share a romantic moment while watching lanterns float up into the sky.

But all attendees got that night were grounded lanterns lit by LED lights, as the organiser was not permitted to fly lanterns with open flames.

Added Mr Tan: ‚ÄúI feel blindsided. I thought the event would be reliable because it was publicised on multiple news sites, and it was hosted on Sentosa.‚Äù

Checks by ST found that Ms Bautista‚Äôs phone number is linked to a cancelled sky lantern festival in Dubai that was meant to take place in 2023. The event, which appeared to have been postponed due to last-minute issues, had also hawked tickets for about $50 each.

In response to queries, a Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) spokeswoman told ST the statutory board was disappointed to hear that the event organiser had backtracked on the initial decision to provide refunds.

‚ÄúAs this is a third-party event, the event organiser makes the final decision to issue refunds or to reschedule,‚Äù she added.

She added that Asian Couture and Boutique has since contacted SDC to hold a similar event, and that SDC had in response reminded it of the need to apply for the necessary licences and permits, and fulfil requirements from the authorities.

Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) president Melvin Yong said the association is engaging with the event organiser to get a full refund for affected consumers, after receiving 15 complaints to date.

He said: ‚ÄúIn general, consumers complained that the segment involving the release of sky lanterns was marketed as the highlight of the event and this was cancelled without prior notice.‚Äù

Mr Yong urged affected consumers to contact Case for help at its hotline on 6277-5100 or on its website.

1b3cr1c,kst14tc,3/1/2024 4:15,wildheart38,"I first came across Taylor Swift when I was still in secondary school. That was more than 15 years ago. I remember the her first song that I have ever listened to was ‚ÄúTeardrops on my Guitar‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt a fan then, because i thought it was just one of the too many love songs out there. 

Then when I was doing O levels, I remember ‚ÄúYou Belong With Me‚Äù was one of the biggest soundtrack for that year. I thought it was catchy but I wasn‚Äôt a convert yet. 

In 2012, amid the Hunger Games fever, I started listening to ‚ÄúSafe and Sound‚Äù. I was about to be enlisted then, and somehow that song really fit into the pre-enlistment vibe i.e. i hope we will be safe and sound as we transitioned from civilians to soldiers. 

I was crushing on my campmate pretty heavily then, even though I didn‚Äôt think we would work out and if we did our union would be a disaster. And yep, that year, I listened to ‚ÄúI Knew You Were Trouble When You Walk In‚Äù. Very fitting. 

I started pretty SERIOUS attention when ‚Äúblank space‚Äù, ‚Äúshake it off‚Äù became icons. And when she played for the Victoria Secret‚Äôs Fashion Show, I was like WOW this woman is unbelievable. I loved her MV (and song) for ‚ÄúWildest Dreams‚Äù. Very Elizabeth Taylor. Haha

In 2015/2016, I fell out with a close friend who was a snake, and ‚ÄúLook What You Made Me Do‚Äù and ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù dominated my playlist. 

Then I graduated from Uni. I remember being hooked onto her ‚ÄúDelicate‚Äù single. And of course, as a gay man, ‚ÄúYou Need To Calm Down‚Äù is an essential track to favourite. Along with ‚ÄúLover‚Äù and ‚ÄúLove Story‚Äù which conjure romantic images and perfect for a lovelorn BBFA like me. 

And sometimes, when I feel insecure and uncomfortable about my appearance or abilities, I seek comfort in ‚ÄúAnti-Hero‚Äù to know that these are common emotions. 

I mean, of course, I dont know ALL her songs. But I know and liked enough songs by her to be her fan and for her to be the only celebrity i will fight tooth and nail for concert tickets. Her songs accompanied me through life, and its not only love. 

I couldnt get tickets to her Eras tour concerts though but I for sure will be heading down for CAT0 seats (outside the stadium).

A cat in my neighbourhood got sick, it's been a while but he still needs medication after his discharge from the vet. I've been stressing over how to administer his medicine, how to make him eat, whether he's unhappy or needs more stimulation here, whether I'm focusing too much on him and not giving my other cats enough attention, whether they can get along. Just feel like I'm going to breakdown because I'm so out of my depth as a novice cat owner trying to take care of a super smart cat with protracted illness, and despite my best intentions, whether him being taken care of by me is the best choice.

The moment I resolved the medicine administering part and my partner didn't have to help, it seems like he just stopped giving any fcks about the cat. Asked him to spend more time with the cat so that the cat isn't so scared of him and he just shrugged it off several times, said that he'll bond with the cat later when he's integrated to the rest of the household. I know that he didn't ask to be a cat rescuer so I shouldn't expect much of him, but it's still rather disappointing to me and makes my saviour complex become pronounced with this sense of ""this cat has no one but me!""

I probably need a good night's sleep to think this through clearly and sort my head out. Ended up crying just now and the cat I'm looking after seemed concerned about me, it was kind of funny.","/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 01, 2024",6,0.75,3/1/2024,0

Hanja is less relevant to students because Hanja education is completely optional in public education system and is not mandated by Korean SAT. As a result, millenials and Gen Z have poor grammar and vocabulary compared to previous generations.


Relevant events:


1. President Park Jong Hee made exclusive use of Hangul plan in 1968 and Hanja education got affected.


2. Korean society moved into information society from 1990s, so Hangul got dominant in the period because it was easier to process¬†Hangul than Hanja with computer.


3. Korean Supreme Court ruled that not mandating Hanja class in public education system is not unconstitutional in 2016.","/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 01, 2024",6,0.75,3/1/2024,0

It usually doesn't. Phishing maybe, if the ""hook"" is some freebie or some gain,

But many redditors like to engage in the reductive argument that scam victims ""deserve it"" because ""they're greedy"". In the process, ignoring the other possible scam angles that play to other types of human vulnerabilities like loneliness, fear, urgency, or even just overloaded mental bandwidth in a moment of lapsed attention.

Inherent in such reductive view is some moral superiority that they (redditor) will never fall prey to scams because they're ""too smart to get scammed"", ""not greedy"", ""always alert"" or some other kind of implied superiority over the lesser mortals who will fall prey.",Victims lose at least S$1.2m to scammers claiming to help them recover lost monies from other scams,161,0.97,3/1/2024,0

Reduce the teacher to student ratio. Taking care of one kid is tiring enough, multiple can be too much.

Flexi-working hours for parents. No amount of money can ensure high quality of care for multiple kids at once. If companies can allow working parent(s) to work at specific timings (7am - 1pm) then continue the remaining hours at their convenience. Settle all meetings and discussions in the morning, keep the 2nd half of the day to finish work and care for kids. This is the most unrealistic but most helpful.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's economy ministry has been asked to coordinate meetings at the working committee level to follow up on several proposals related to the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ).

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said this on Wednesday (Feb 28) during a Johor state development meeting in Putrajaya, which he chaired.

The meeting was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister Fadillah Yusof, several ministers and the chief secretaries of the ministries involved.

Johor Chief Minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi, members of the state's executive council and relevant state department heads were also present at the meeting.

It was the first such meeting involving the state government and 13 related ministries. It focused on comprehensive coordination for high-impact development projects in Johor.

""The meeting discussed the current progress status of JS-SEZ and the Special Financial Zone (SFZ),"" Anwar said in a post shared on his social media platforms on Wednesday.

Anwar, who is also finance minister, said that various programmes and projects to upgrade infrastructure and public facilities were also discussed during the meeting.

""These include the Senai to Sedenak expressway, Sedenak to Simpang Renggam, and Senai to Desaru. Flood mitigation plans for the Segamat, Kota Tinggi and Batu Pahat districts. Construction of the Sultanah Aminah 2 hospital and upgrading works for Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Sultan Iskandar Building and the Sultan Abu Bakar Complex,"" he said.

""Proposals for traffic dispersal, traffic management and congestion in Johor Bahru city and the direction of (the) Iskandar Rapid Transit (project), Johor's water supply involving Sungai Pontian Besar, Sungai Sedili Besar, Sungai Gembut, Air Layang 2 and Sungai Johor,"" he added.

The prime minister said all these projects are high-impact initiatives for the people, especially the residents of Johor who will enjoy long-term benefits.

SINGAPORE: Singapore gym chain Ritual has ceased operations at all four outlets here, saying it has placed the company in provisional liquidation.

It informed customers of the decision in an email on Thursday (Feb 29), saying: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, despite our best efforts to continue operating, we have decided to close the business and have ceased operations at all locations in Singapore.""

The boutique gym is known for offering 20-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. Its four affected outlets are at Holland Village, Orchard Road, East Coast and Tiong Bahru.

Co-founded by former mixed martial arts fighter Brad Robinson and fitness coach Ian Tan, Ritual opened its first outlet in Boat Quay in 2013.

It also has outlets overseas, owned by franchisees, in Brazil and Spain.

""While we have placed the company into provisional liquidation, we are also exploring ways to get the Ritual experience back up and running as soon as possible,"" the company said in its email to customers.

Ended up having to do stock take during my shift. Went into one of the stock room where our brand's stock was located and saw a person standing in the middle of some shelves. Their back was to me but they seemed to be just standing still. Thought it was another staff taking a break or maybe doing stock take too, so I just said ""Hello, I'm gonna do stock take ah."" and spent like 2 hours in there.

Occasionally, I would look up because I hear shuffling and would still see that person standing in the same spot. Idk how or why but I didn't think it was weird at that time. The stock room was also very dim because there was only 1 light and the shelves were very tall. A few people would come in and out to drink water and I would turn around and acknowledge them. After I finished, I left the room. Decided to ask the other staff who is the person inside and they said they didn't see anyone in there. I was alone. That was the day I found out exactly which stock room was haunted.

1b3ina3,kstbvd0,3/1/2024 5:46,Dumas1108,"This incident happened in 1990 after I had graduated from PA, posted to F Div and was attached to my FTO.

I was doing FRC FR30, It was nightshift and was about 4am. 

Usually around this timing, when all is quiet, we also take our break aka naps. 

My FTO drove the patrol car while I was updating the patrol log sheet. We were heading deep inside Seletar reservoir for our ""rest"".

My FTO suddenly stopped the patrol car, got out and seems to be conducting a spot-check. He actually took out his walkie talkie set and radioed our Div Ops Room to screen a person. I was in a state of shock as I was in the front passenger seat and what is happening, I can see directly and clearly. I can see no one except for my FTO. 

After a couple of mins, he got back into the patrol car and started to F me for not getting out of the patrol car to assist him on the spot check. 

I said ""Brother, there is no one out there except you. You were like talking to yourself""

At moment, someone or something jumped onto the roof of our patrol car and started scratching it. The scratching sound is like someone scratching on the classroom blackboard.

Our goose pimples stood up and my FTO floored the aclerator and we sped out of there. 

We reached a petrol station and we both got out of the patrol car. On top of the patrol car were 5 lines of deep scratches. 

We agreed not to mention this to the Transport Sgt or any of our Team Policing team mates as our encounter is too incredible to be believed and also that we will probably be the target of jokes for the next couple of weeks from them. 

We actually came up with a cock and bull story to the Transport Sgt regarding how the patrol car sustained those scratches.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0
1b3ina3,kssozu9,3/1/2024 2:49,vancomyxin,"I was serving midnight antibiotics in the male cubicle which has 6 beds. I was attending to one of the patient closest to the entrance with my back towards the other patients. Halfway through serving antibiotics I heard a very deep male voice clearly and loudly saying ‚ÄúNurse!‚Äù across the cubicle. Naturally I turned my head around trying to see which patient is calling me, although it was dark but I would still be able to make out if someone is trying to get my attention. However everyone seems to be fine so I only walk to each patient to check on them after I was done with the antibiotics. But everyone was sleeping except for one guy still playing with his phone so I asked him if he had called out for me but he said he did not and didn‚Äôt hear anyone else calling for nurse. I was spooked tbh haha

The other encounter happened around evening 6-7pm. I was looking for extra towels for one of my patients but it ran out in linen trolley. So the next possible place to search for towels will be the unoccupied single rooms. The layout single room is that once you enter there is a short corridor before it opens out to the room with the bed. The towels are usually kept in the cupboard next to the bed so you will have to turn right to get to the cupboards. So I entered one of the rooms and just as I was about to turn right to the cupboards, I saw a blackish humanoid figure standing next to cupboard. At that moment, idk why I thought it was a relative waiting in the room for the arrival of a new incoming patient. So without thinking, I immediately apologised, turn around and left the room. It was when I left the room, then I realised something wasn‚Äôt right because I didn‚Äôt see any facial features on that figure.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0

1b3ina3,kstw3vy,3/1/2024 9:35,Makaisaurus,"Section mate got possessed around Macritchie/Island Country Club during navigation exercise. 

Was in the navex area, with Island Country Club‚Äôs golf course and the reservoir being the border of the area and we already reached the edge and bashed out into the club premises, there was no fencing, just road crash guards separating the golf course and the jungle, we just stepped over. 

It was past the exercise cutoff time but section mate loudly said he was demoralised and wanted to continue finding our last elusive checkpoint, we took a break on the guard rails while him and another guy went back into the jungle to find. Heard them shouting shortly after and panic running back to us. 

He was pale AF and the other sectionmate was supporting him, we could tell something was wrong so decided to break out the emergency phone call for encik assistance while walking to island country club building to be in a more crowded area. Halfway down the service road, he screamed about being followed and shortly blacked out, he came to in less than a minute, but with another personality, deep voice, and super human strength (I was 50+kg, he was 65kg, 5 of us pinned him down and I sat on his arm and he lifted me off the ground) all that. 

Long story short, we wrestled him and dragged him to clubhouse, encik came, club staff came out, OC and CSM came, calmed him down with prayers and thai buddhist amulets. Country Club staff asked where we were, said near the water and they said common sightings of Pontianak around there, but golf course visitors never go near the water (it‚Äôs past their road barriers and quite a distance in). 

OC was convinced that his Thai amulets worked, 2 sergeants carried him to their rover to bring him to Nee Soon medical centre while they told us they didn‚Äôt cater transport for us and we had to walk the jungle path back to a bus waiting at our start point. We fast marched that 2-3km back in all staring at our feet, never got thigh abrasions so bad before lol. 

We reached back camp at 2am, OC woke every cadet, did a quick debrief and praised us for our bravery (more like scared and just sat on a friend). Dude came back a day after saying he felt like his arms were broken, and he had a week of MC. From then on, every time he threw a tantrum, OC always feared an incomplete exorcism, while we knew he was just brash, and the timid and scared personality he had that night was super off.

Edit: Forgot to mention that the possessed guy said he remembered being grabbed by the ankle while he climbed under a fallen log which his buddy climbed over before him. He looked down and saw a hand, wrist and an oily mess of what looked like hair that‚Äôs when he screamed and kicked and ran out of the forest with his buddy. He also said that a shadowy figure followed us all the way until he blacked out, don‚Äôt think anyone of us saw the figure, but we saw the aftermath. The two super fit sergeants also told us the next day that when they were carrying him to their rover, he weighed way more than 65kg, like they were carrying 2 people.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0

Had a few experiences:

1st Experience: 

After reveille parade, bunk mates and I were the first to reach our bunks before anyone else. My BMT mates and I were about to reach our bunk when the door suddenly slammed shut on us, at first we thought someone was in our bunk already. Opened the door and it was pitch black and windows all still closed, we were all freaked out after that. 

2nd Experience:

During BMT, I always woke up at 3am for some reason. Like my body would just wake itself up, always looked around my bunk for a bit but I would eventually go back to sleep quite fast.

Then one night, my company had a particularly long day of training so end of the day I was shag as hell. Before lights out, we were warned by our sergeants that they would be conducting spot checks once lights out. 

Then 3am and I woke up suddenly again, my bed happened to face the window to the corridor and my bunk was next to the toilet so at night the corridor is quite dark, I turned to the window and I saw a figure standing there in the dark looking into my bunk. Thought it was one of the sergeant‚Äôs checking if we were all asleep, but I as stared at the figure I realised it had really long hair, realised what I was looking at but as I was damn tired I didn‚Äôt even feel fear.

I'm not sure if the route still exists since I haven't been at Pasir Ris for a while, but there's a way that leads you to Pasir Ris MRT which involves going through the mangrove, and this was the route that my friends took.

1b3ina3,kstk4a6,3/1/2024 7:11,InstantlyLyrical,"Tekong always has a few.

During BMT and outfield, a few of us heard the sound of someone crying at night. We initially thought it was a cat or something. Later, a few of the guys on patrol heard their names being called immediately after the crying stopped. This also happened to guy who went to the toilet alone at night. Anyone who needed to go, went with buddy after. Mst Sgt later say very normal but don't respond if name being called like this :D 

We had a night march on one of the nights, and as part of the exercise, we were all walking in formation, but 10m apart, and in one area they had us through almost jungle area, the foliage so dense, so we can't see shit. Some guys in my section saw faces in the trees. One of the odd things that also happened before that was we had been walking all this while with jockey caps, but specifically before this we were asked to switched to beret, which didn't make much sense. Later, we asked encik and were told that apparently all emblems are considered blessed, and anything funny won't come near as long as they got beret on.We thought he just teasing sia but later once was talking to thai friends (ex-police), and apparently, they were told the exact same thing during their training. So when they patrolled at night, everyone kept their cap on.

This one happened at my workplace. My company relocated office (near star vista) and within 2 months of relocation, a few people passed away at work. All unnatural causes (met with accident, diagnosed with stage 4 cancer etc). Then people leaving office late saw shadows moving in office. HR got to know that lot of people were a bit spooked but, of course don't want to admit something like this. Then one day, they came up with a cock and bull story that never properly inaugurate office so had some priest from different religion walk around the office saying prayers one random day. Everything stopped after and no more shadows etc.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0
1b3ina3,kstg7f7,3/1/2024 6:29,ICanBeAnAssholeToo,"At my workplace we are a technical based industry (aka not office so people will be walking around a bit). 

One day me and a colleague were in this room, just two of us. The room has no windows and it supplied with filtered air with higher pressure such that air will rush out the room when the door opens. I was at station A, colleague was at station B. We were in mid conversation when she interrupted to ask me if I can smell that weird foul smell. I couldn‚Äôt smell anything. She ask me to go over to her station where she is still smelling it, I did but there‚Äôs no smell there. We decided to change topic (cos we know our place has its resident spirits)

A few days later this happens again, but roles swapped. I can smell it but colleague cannot. At my station A and not her station. 

And then again a week later, this time with more people in the room. Only I can smell it, at a different location in the same room. No one else could smell the foul rotting smell even when they stand on the same spot as I did.

Coincidentally that night my family went to the temple with tang ki. I told Guan Yin/goddess of mercy in the tang ki that my work place something weird is happening and I ask if I need to be concerned. She said not to worry and she will take care of it. 

The next day we were in the room again. About 5 of us were there including the colleague in the first two incidents. This time, I smelled something unexplainable again, but it wasn‚Äôt the foul rotting smell. Instead it was a strong sweet smell of lotus. I am familiar with the smell of lotus as Gryphon tea has a lotus flavored tea that I like and I‚Äôve bought and used lotus scented products and essential oils before. And this smell is exactly like that. 

Anyway the smell was not faint or anything it was strong like someone wear perfume standing beside you, but no one else in the room could smell it but me. Even if they stood in my place, they could not smell it. If I walked away to the other end of the room, I couldn‚Äôt smell it. But when I came back to the spot it was strong as ever. The smell was present for a good 5 min too so I know It wasn‚Äôt just my imagination or mind playing tricks on me. 

After this lotus smell, we never had an incident with the rotting smell ever again. 

And to top the cherry off, someone from the other department actually has the third eye. During this rotten smell period he told me he noticed two new spirits who were attached to something in the corridor outside this room. They were kid spirits. After the lotus smell incident he said the new spirits were no longer there. 

There are other details of the story that ties the whole story in together better but I cannot tell them because it‚Äôs too specific for my workplace  and I know I have colleagues on Reddit. But I strongly believe the lotus smell was Guan Yin or another higher being who came down to bring the two kid spirits away. It is said that the breath of holy or pure ones in Buddhism will smell like lotus. And I only learnt of this after this incident and trying to see if lotus has any special meanings.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0

One night I was teaching private tuition in Tampines area, near the old TPJC, ended late, about 9+ pm.¬†


Blur me took the wrong feeder bus, and got off after I realised the bus was turning the wrong way. Alighted, and I could smell something burning, it was incense. But I looked around, no one was burning any Joss paper, and the bus stop was a considerable distance from any hdb.


I thought to myself, this is creepy, so I hurried back the way the I came from ,before the bus took a wrong turn. Suddenly, I felt something lightly tugging my messenger bag by the strap.


I tried to ignore it, thinking maybe my shirt got caught in something, so I started walking faster towards the traffic light in the distance. As soon as I picked up the pace, something tugged my messenger bag again.


I started jogging, and it tugged me again.


SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT, I started sprinting, and it gave me one last tug, so hard I almost fell backwards, then I reached the traffic light sobbing.

There were a lot of weird things that just kept happening until one late night when that 'spirit‚Äô decided to show itself to my mother in the kitchen when she was in the kitchen. My father had also seen a ‚Äòdark shadow‚Äô running past in the living room when he came back home one night.

By ‚Äòweird things‚Äô, I‚Äôm referring to random toilet flushes throughout the day, random knocks on the window, lights switching on and off by itself, sudden chillness in the whole room in the middle of the day, AND RANDOM KNOCKS ON THE ALUMINIUM WINDOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ALONG WITH A LADY'S VOICE!¬†

Because it was an old flat (built in the late 1970s), the flat has a squatting-type toilet, so you need to pull in order to flush the toilet. As for the windows, it‚Äôs those aluminum window louvres with a RUSTY AF iron grille. Lastly, because the block is set to be en bloc, there weren‚Äôt many occupants, and we were the only ones occupying a unit on that storey.¬†

For me, I didn‚Äôt see the 'spirit', but something mind-blowing happened. My parents had to attend to some matters, and I couldn‚Äôt tag along because I had school the next day, so I was alone that night. I was asleep when I felt sudden chills and heard sudden knocks on my room door. I ignored it and closed my eyes when my room door started opening by itself. Wanna know what‚Äôs even scarier? I have a habit of locking my room door, and I clearly remembered doing so that night before heading to bed. Needless to say, I was scared sh\*tless and couldn‚Äôt sleep till the next morning.¬†

Also, there were a few suicide cases at that block throughout the period I lived there. I also personally witnessed it once when the uncle leaped off the building, and the scene was so gruesome to the point where it is still embedded in my memory.¬†The block no longer exists and has been demolished.

Edit: I remember reading one Twitter user documenting his 'exploration' at the block I lived in. Mothership has an article about it too a few years back.

We were all having dinner and games and I remember having to go back to our tent to grab something. Our tent was probably 5m or so from a big tree. When I walked past the tree, I noticed a light shining up towards the canopy from the trunk. I could make out what seemed like facial features of a disembodied head. I was creeped out but I was kinda just looking at it from the corner of my eye whilst walking to my tent. Quickly grabbed my stuff and booted to join the rest of the peeps who were probably just 50m from where I was.

While walking down this stretch of pavement (under trees), I felt something small fall on my head so while sweeping my hair, I looked around discreetly on the floor to see what it might have been - didn't spot anything that might have dropped.  When we rounded back on the same path, it was my husband's turn to feel something fall on his head.  He (walking in front of me) made a remark about it and I felt something like cloth sweeping over me from my forehead to the back of my head.  I quickened my pace and told him I wanted to get to the block and buy a drink - sort of pretended I didn't feel anything weird.

When we reached home, I told him about what I felt and he said it must be spider webs or something.  The next evening, I didn't want to go for our walk, so he went with a buddy on the same route just to prove to me it was nature and not supernatural.  Well, this time, supernatural slapped both of them on their heads literally.

As I was walking along the road and passing by one of the side gates, I felt the air get still and cold.. and I almost felt like someone directly behind me, inches away from the back of my head just staring into my skull. Got a growing sense of dread and I just noped out of there and jogged to the nearest traffic junction. Felt much better when I got closer to civilization.

People were like you gotta pray if you meet these kinda things, I tried but I couldn't move at all at the time and just froze.

Tilted my head slightly to my right and saw a tall, dark silhouette looking at me / the bunk through the corridor window. It noticed me, then moved away from the window. I kicked my buddy‚Äôs bed (bunk above me) to wake him up. I said bro got ghost sia, I going out to check. I opened the door slowly so as to not wake up the others, and peeked down the corridor. I could see the stairway and toilet at the end, and felt that there was something looking back at me from the shadows. Made all my hair stand immediately. I forced my buddy to go and check it out with me, but didn‚Äôt see anything else when we went to the toilet / stairs. 

2nd:
Tekong again. Was sleeping in the evening during admin time, and my bunk bed was next to corridor window. I was alone in the bunk, so I closed the doors. I had a nightmare where I was lying on the bed, and the left door of the bunk was slightly open instead of fully closed, and a dark, evil figure extended its jet black arm through that crack in the door, stretching towards me as it pressed against the wall, and its claw like hands opened up right in front of my face to grip my neck. Its face was in the corridor window on the right of my bed, and although it had no facial features, I swear I could see it grinning. I woke up sweating and choking. Looked up at the door and it was slightly open, just like in the dream. went to take out my rosary from under my pillow, and found it broken.

3rd
Walking around Pulau Ubin late at night with some friends. We were deep into the forested area / away from the main jetty. They needed to pee so they went together inside the bushes, where I couldn‚Äôt see them. I didn‚Äôt want to walk in so I stayed at the roadside alone and used my phone. I heard an old woman‚Äôs voice next to me, asking: ‚Äúah boy, ‰Ω†Ëá™Â∑±‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∫∫ÂïäÔºü‚Äù I didn‚Äôt sense anything weird, thought she was just a local grandma having a midnight walk‚Ä¶ I said no, my friends are nearby. She told me to be careful, it‚Äôs dangerous here at night. I thanked her, and then sent my friends a text asking them to hurry up. I realised how weird that was, and after I looked up, she was nowhere in sight. It was a long, flat road.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0

I was about 8yo, at home alone with my mom. She was in the kitchen cooking and I was in her room brushing my teeth. I looked up at the mirror and saw a black figure float past the toilet door. Thought was mom. Finished brushing and went to kitchen and saw my mom there, was surprised and said:"" I thought you went into the room to get something."".

Always got brand new long hair inside? None of us in bunk have long hair and my locker was locked with a padlock ü§®

Woke up at 3am to go toilet. Toilet door was locked and I heard showers running inside and no sound of movement. Since door lock so I went back to sleep. Next day at reveille we all stuck outside toilet cos its still locked and shower running. So no choice cannot brush teeth and told sergeant about it.

So i was facing the direction of the church/entrance to the mrt from the ground level when I suddenly felt a wave of intense fear coming from the direction i was facing. Idk how to really express it but it was like a gut feeling that just said DANGER - super primal and freaky. I straight up just turn around and walked back to the direction of plaza sing.

whenever i would get assigned to work in that section, my entire body would get extremely itchy. rashes and all that. but as soon as i stepped outside of that section and moved to another, the itching would stop almost immediately. i mean, i was in a warehouse. its dusty all over in every single section. there was no reason why i would only experience rashes in that one specific area!!! 

also when i was working in that section i almost always see (what i thought was) other staff passing by the shelves in front of me. literally a figure quickly dodging around and disappearing behind blind spots. so i walked down the entire stretch of shelves in that area to check if anyone was around. and each time, the result would be the same - i was only one there. couldve sworn i saw a face staring at me through the gaps of the shelves one time, but i was already having a bad day at work and was too angry too be scared lmao",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/1/2024,0
1b3ina3,kswqxts,3/1/2024 21:10,Eseru,"I used to live in an old private apartment in Primary school where the lift was v slow. Took the school bus, and the driver made it clear if he waited more than 5 mins he'd leave without us. One day I was a bit over time and had to rush down. The lift for some reason was on its way up and I decided to run down the stairs.

Halfway down, I heard someone walking up and breathing very heavily, and some metallic clinking sounds that I couldn't place. I thought it was a bit weird that someone would be walking back up at 6am in the morning. Like, I've run down the stairs more than a few times and never encountered anyone going up in the morning.

When I rounded the stairs I was super creeped out, it was a guy in one of those totally white traditional pants and shirt, almost like the kind you see men wearing under their robes in Chinese period dramas. He had long hair that covered his face and he was breathing heavily.

I didn't want to stop and look too carefully or run back up. My kid brain was rationalizing that it was probably just a creepy weirdo on his way back home and the best thing I could do was just act normal and not attract his attention by behaving oddly.

So I just didn't look at him too closely and rushed past him. I remember him stopping completely and the super creepy sounds of his heavy breathing as I passed.

I grew up in a Christian household so I only found out about Tua Ah Pek after this incident. Years later one of my friends whose father is a medium told me I should've greeted him, then told my parents to take me to buy lottery.

Had something like that outside of NS, before it actually. I was part of something where we needed to train to be instructors. One evening when we were walking to the bus stop after training, this very large built guy (probably heavier than 80+kg? And only 17/18 at the time) just suddenly lost his shit, and starting screaming and yelling. Even tried to run in front of the bus as it came towards the bus stop. 

Took about 6/7 of us just to stop him from running out and even then we were getting overpowered by this one guy who had been more of a gentle giant in the couple of months we'd known him for at the time. IIRC we managed to stop him and then forced him to sit down on the road side as one of us ran back to get the trainers. 

When the trainers got to us, they put him in a car and drove off. Later we were told it was a panic attack, but I've never seen anyone flip like that so fast and suddenly become stronger than 5-7 people.

I was a prowler and I encountered weird stuff at the second last of last block (near to the small substation and side gate).  

We are supposed to clock in at certain locations.  During our 2-3am prowl, we walked past this block.  we noticed one of the bunks‚Äô lights were left on.  Strangely during our previous prowls we didn‚Äôt noticed it.  And there was no one else in camp.  The bunk was occupied by medical officers cadets and we knew all had booked out.   Knowing how strict our school RSM was, we went to investigate.  

The lights at the first stairs landing was flickering.  Strangely when we approached it, about five metres away, the lights went back to normal.  

We made our way up.  Along the way I checked the toilets to see if it was occupied.  All toilet lights were off.  

We reached the bunk and the door was ajar.  This is weird though as the bunk doors were supposed to be locked if no one is in.   We yelled into the bunk asking anyone was around.  Dead silence greeted us.  We scanned the bunks.  Then we made our way in.  There was totally no one.  We switched off the lights, closed the door and made our way down.  

After we left the building, the lights at the first landing resumed its flickering.  Till today I found the whole experience strange.   Who switched on the lights?  Why no one noticed it in earlier prowls?  Perhaps he was in the toilet, some might say.  But the lights were out for all the toilets (I checked on my way up).

At first I thought it was my buddy trying to take something out of our locker so I didn‚Äôt bother. But after awhile, I got quite worried because I couldn‚Äôt hear anyone else talking or moving in the bunk. (It was our first night with 13 strangers sleeping in that bunk for the first time).

So I decided to say quite loudly, ‚ÄòBuddy are you
moving the cabinet?‚Äô So as to be clear I was abit uncomfortable. He told me he thought it was me. 
At this point my whole bunk started to ask what‚Äôs going on, and we decided to all huddle in the middle of the room just to see what was causing the noise. It was when the cabinet continued shaking, with all 14 of us in the middle of the room, that we freaked out.

I ran downstairs to the sergeant‚Äôs rooms and told them about it. I fully expected to be ridiculed. 
Stupid Chao recruit causing us problems on day 1.
But no, they told me to wait outside, they closed the door, and in maybe 20 seconds they came out with a Chinese ceremonial sword and told me to wait downstairs. They went upstairs without me for maybe 5 minutes, came down and told me to go back to sleep. After that, there was no more shaking. 

I know there are many ghost stories about Tekong, but I shit you not, this actually happened. 

I had many thoughts trying to rationalize the situation. Maybe it was a rat? Or my buddy was playing a prank on me? But it never happened again, and my entire bunk witnessed it.

The whole theatre was empty and only 2 of us watching. They had these recliner chairs, so at first we thought quite shiok like whole place we can sit anywhere we want. We tried testing the chair reclining function and many were not working. We eventually found 2 seats there were working and the movie started. 

About 10 mins later my gf chair suddenly jerked. She jumped and got very scared, I told her maybe it‚Äôs the mechanism inside not very good due to the vibrations from the sound it moved. So we continued a bit more, after 5 mins the whole chair leg rest retreat. My gf full panic and she told me she saw the drink lid she put on the armrest to the left of her flew behind, so I tell her we switch seats so maybe she feel safer on the right. Gave her my chair and I sat in her chair, afterwards her chair(which was my chair) leg rest went down again. I was spooked as well but I wanted to be brave so I tell her it‚Äôs okay let‚Äôs just focus on the movie. 

At this point of time, we finished eating our popcorn chicken, I put the cup and the lid to my side (away from us) inside the cup holder. Shortly after from the corner of my eye I saw something white move but didn‚Äôt think much of it . So I turn to my left to take a look and stare at the cup. I think it was only about 10 seconds but the fork inside the cup flew out to the back of the cinema. Then the whole cup fly out like 1-2 seconds later. Like someone tie a string and pull the cup and fork out. I was stunned. I immediately turn to my gf say let‚Äôs get the f out. The movie was only like 40 mins in but I‚Äôm not watching anymore. 

We went to the counter they ask why we are leaving we say weird things happen inside, then my gf suggest they turn on the lights and we continue watching. So they did and we walk back into the cinema hall. I stood at the front and saw a black shadow move across the seats at the back(as the lights were on now). I told my gf let‚Äôs go lol I can‚Äôt watch here anymore.

It was lull period, so there wasn't any recruits around. I was the COS during the weekend, as I was about to retire for the night, I received a phone call from the neighboring company COS saying that one of the recruit bunk lights was on, located at the top floor of my company. I came out to take a look and true enough the lights were on. I told him it's late at night and it's the 7th month, I'll check on it the next morning. When I went to check it the next day, I got a shock of my life. The lights and fans were on. There were blood stains everywhere, on the bunk beds, the walls, the cabinets and tons of dead birds, some dead birds were found in the cage fan. I believe these birds flew into cage fans and the ceiling fans. I informed encik about it and he told me a media company came to stay over but forget to off the lights n fans before they left. But that doesn't explain why the birds would commit suicide? Thankfully I didn't went to investigate the night before if not I could have contributed to the blood stains as well.

I was training to be a lifeguard. During that time we had the opportunity to go to an offshore island to help ferry passengers alight from the ferry. 

The island was small with only a temple on it. Devotees will go to pray in the temple on the island. The name of the island is Kusu island.

So our job was to help the visitors in the morning and we will stay the night at this hut on the island til the next day. We finished our job around 5 or 6pm and we were all gathered to rest after dinner.

At this point, there should be no one on the island except us and the ones who takes care of the temple.

We suddenly heard a sharp female voice shouting for help around 9pm. At this time we were all together and all of us heard the scream for help. As lifeguards, we thought someone was in danger and begin our search. We paired up and combed the entire island but found nobody. 

After confirming that it wasnt the caretaker or us, we decided to let it rest. Til this day i remember this incident very clearly since it was one of the most prominent unexplained incident that happened to me.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/2/2024,0

I kept hearing the moaning pain in midnight at the top of the bed.

Never have I in my life, I was so afraid that I frozed for 1-2 hours and dare not move.

Until, I mustered my courage and tried to find out the source of the voice...

It turns out, my buddy sleeping on top was sleep talking. But in the zombie, incomprehensible way.

1b3ina3,ksziw5b,3/2/2024 10:56,Eseru,"This reminds me of when I did an excursion with the Singapore Paranormal Investigators for fun, not sure they're still around. One of the members told me this story:

 Some blocks in Redhill got SERS and most of the people had moved out.

SPI then got a call from one of the remaining residents about some weird stuff happening in their downstairs neighbour's flat. He was still hearing sounds of people moving around in there, slamming doors etc even though the occupants had already moved out.  The guy who told me the story was one of the people who went to investigate.

They couldn't get into the empty flats but they did set up some motion detectors and other equipment to measure. According to then when a spirit manifests it's usually accompanied by a temperature drop. Their theory is the being is absorbing energy from the area. 

The SPI people took turns to sit at the stairwell to monitor and during the guy's shift, the motion detector suddenly went off. He ran to the flat and heard the sound of a door being opened and slammed closed from outside. He managed to open the corridor window and saw one of the room doors just opening and slamming close by itself. 

The next week he fell really ill and had to take almost a week's mc. When he went back to work, a colleague who was ""sensitive"" kept coming up and asking if she could pray for him. When he asked her why she asked to speak privately and told him she had been seeing an old man and a little boy following him around the last few days.

I don't know how exactly he got rid of them, he told me it's not for him to reveal because his colleague was a bit sensitive about her abilities. But she did help him out and after the spirits left, his health immediately got much better.

Anyway, I'm guessing with these old flats and SERS, if the spaces are unoccupied for a certain amount of time, other things move in.",[TGIF] Share your paranormal experiences in Singapore here!,635,0.96,3/2/2024,0

1. Went for a big uniform group cca camp in somewhere ulu in the north. Everyone had to sleep in those big tentage area together(like those outdoor events kind). Everything was okay except for I think the last night, one participant was huddled up in fetus position and covering his eyes. He seems terrified and an instructor was comforting him. By then a crowd was sort of forming around him but the instructors eventually dispersed us and told us to apply baby power on our feet and immediately lights out.

No sure what the baby powder was for or what happened to the participant but evening was normal for the rest of the camp. 

2. So before I was on this uniform cca, I was in a sport cca and quit to join this uniform group. I was in the sports cca for a year and in our camp, our teacher in charger also told us the principle said not to stay overnight in the hall but didn't say why (I just chalked it up to my teacher trying to create some atmosphere and fun with the typical ghost stories)

After I join in the uniform group, was going through the documents in our cca group when we reach sec 3 and got assigned some roles.

Found this old document entry about how some malay dance group had a camp in the hall years ago and got attacked by something and someone felt their heart being squeezed (red cross so the teacher probably has to attend to them and made the entry).

1b3ina3,kt9nb27,3/4/2024 7:26,cockerspanielbarney,"Hi, I'm super duper late to the party but here are a number of my encounters:

1) a number of years ago I worked in a game dev coy. My office was located in a very old building opposite one north. Not gonna be too specific on the place! 

One night a few colleagues (4 of us total) OT-ed till 11+ pm. The building was very dark, as other coys on our floor had already left for the day. The only source of light other than our office came from the ceiling lamp outside. We clocked out, turned off the lights and exited the office doors. Our office doors were glass, and the lift was directly opposite it. While waiting for the lift, the solitary light above us started to flicker.

Suddenly my colleague motioned to us to look to our left. We turned, and watched our reflection in the glass doors. However, while the light above us continued to flicker erratically, the one in the reflection did not.

The ding from the lift sounded and we silently filed in, not saying a word till we left the building and got to the main road to flag for cabs home.

2) my family lives in a maisonette in Serangoon. My hubs and I lived there before moving out. I run a home based catering biz so I will sometimes work till very late at night while everyone is fast asleep.

During these nights my dog will sleep by the kitchen door waiting for me to go up to bed. One night my hubs was back in his hometown and I was in a call with him while I worked. I remember working on raw meat then.

Suddenly there was a smell that was sickly sweet. It smelled like a mix of detergent/hair wash/flowers, and it seemed to be slowly filling up my kitchen. I wasn't bothered by it at first as I thought it could be the smell of my neighbor showering and the water flowing thru the pipes, but it suddenly clicked in me on what it could be.

I stopped talking, picked up my knife and my honing rod, and started to slowly swipe my knife back and forth on it. I said out loud 'i know how to use a knife, I am not afraid.' my hubs went like 'wtf y r u suddenly threatening me' but I shushed him.

The smell was so thick now, so I continued swiping my knife and repeated what I said. I took my knife to the open kitchen window and said loudly 'i know how to use a knife, I am not afraid of you'. Within the next few seconds I swear the smell dissipated fully. I shut the windows, asked my hubs to continue talking to me while I quickly cleaned up the kitchen.

While all this was happening I noticed my dog was no longer at his usual spot. When I left the kitchen I found him in the dark living room facing the windows (same direction as the kitchen window) in full alert mode. I quickly scooped him up to bed. 

When I brought this up with a Chinese colleague who lived in sg, she actually said 'OH do you mean a smell that's like a mix of detergent, hair wash and flowers? Ya I sometimes smell that at night too! But only in sg and msia, never in china!

3) one night my hubs and I returned home really late, 2am++. We entered the flat, locked up, kept our shoes and tidied up the foyer while having mundane conversation. 

Suddenly we heard a distinct creeeeeak from the main door. Our heads snapped over, and we both watched the knob for the door lock slowly turn anticlockwise.The knob turned one full circle and went click, then continued turning. Before it reached another full circle to mean that the door was fully unlocked, my hubs shot his arm out, and in one swift motion unlocked the door and yanked it open. 

There was nobody outside. The gate outside our main door was locked. There was considerable distance between the two that it would be difficult to reach in and unlock the door. Even if there was someone outside playing punk with us, it would be impossible to run away and hide within the seconds that my husband pulled the door open. We were a corner unit, and there was another unit before a stairwell. My hubs is a sceptic but he was 100% shooketh. He later admitted it was the most terrifying thing he's ever encountered. 

But my hubs noticed his bunch of keys were actually stuck into the lock of the main door! So we thought oh ok that must have explained the turning! We pulled the keys out, locked up again and hurriedly went up to bed.

Why do NSFs not deserve a dignified wage? Why only an allowance for basic personal upkeep? Why is the burden of defence disproportionately levied upon a small segment of the population? Does SMS Chee not understand the basic economic concept of opportunity cost?

One was talking about how they‚Äôd manage to get their son complete exemption and how he was going on to a top uni this year. Others were asking for tips on how to get their sons exemptions. Everyone knew full well what they were doing, but everyone also put their sons first.

In the workplace, I have coworkers who actively brainstorm about how to get their soon-to-be-awarded-PR sons out of the country by 10 or 11 to avoid the dreaded draft. Yes, PRs and new citizens who themselves avoided NS trying to help their sons do the same. Heck, don‚Äôt even get me started on the expat boss who jokingly said that he‚Äôd hire foreigners over citizens to avoid the annual ICT burden.

But can you really blame these people? Ministers can quip all they want about how NS is a duty (lol) but these people can see NS for what it is - a liability. And these are smart and successful people, whose sons will probably go on to reap the economic benefits of having skipped NS to become equally smart and successful.

So cut the bullshit. When you have people who have the means sparing no effort to help their offspring avoid this waste of 2 years - aka a liability - you know the system is broken. But obviously you keep the ones you can control, average citizens without the means, captive in this broken system, talk them down into subservience, and maybe once in a while extol the supposed benefits of NS.

For whom are we defending this country? Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How posed this question in Parliament on Wednesday (Feb 29).

""Is it for the Ministry of Defence? For the Singapore Armed Forces? No, it's for each and every Singaporean, for now and for the future,"" he said in his ministry's budget debate.

Earlier on, Workers' Party MP Gerald Giam said that the current philosophy of giving full-time National Servicemen (NSF) an allowance for basic upkeep needs to be reviewed.

This is in light of the ""significant increase"" in cost of living and the opportunity cost of doing two years of national service, he said.

""As a first step, the terminology should be changed from 'NS allowance' to 'NS salary' and it should attract CPF contributions,"" Giam suggested, adding that the median annual salary should be at least the local qualifying salary of $1,600 a month.

""This does not in any way diminish the ethos of national service, just because we pay our NSFs fairly,"" he emphasised.

In response, SMS Heng said that national service is a duty to the country, and not a form of employment.

""Instead of a salary, NSFs receive an allowance to support their basic upkeep and this allowance is regularly reviewed ‚Äî most recently in July 2023,"" he added.

He pointed out that the NSFs' allowance has been reviewed four times in the last 10 years.

""We will continue to review to make sure that the allowance will remain relevant,"" SMS Heng said.

Seeking clarification on SMS Heng's explanation that NS is ""a duty to country and not employment"", Giam asked: ""However, does the SMS agree that two are not mutually exclusive?""

""SAF regulars for example, they are both employees and serving their national duty.

""But that does not detract, in any way, their sense of national duty.""

Emphasising that he supports national service, Giam reiterated that the NS allowance should ""reflect the realities of the opportunity costs that national servicemen have to incur.""

While national is a duty of citizens to protect Singapore, SMS Heng said, NSFs are not enlisted as volunteers.

""We recognise that we will call on their time for two years. And that during this period, they will need a basic upkeep as they fulfil this duty to Singapore,"" he said.

""This is why we regularly update and enhance the allowance that we pay to our national servicemen.""

Last May, the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs announced that all national servicemen in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force will receive a raise in their monthly allowance starting from July.

The amount ranged from $125 to $200, depending on their rank and vocation. This was an increment by between 10.9 per cent and 21.7 per cent, the ministries added.

During the 1960s right after  our independence, Singapore  who was a small nation within a not so friendly neighbourhood was in need of a credible defense force. We all knew well that no one was willing to help us except the ~~Israelis~~ Mexicans.

It was then concluded that in order to have a standing defense force that is credible, it will not be economical to maintain a regualr army(100% salary). Hence it was proposed to have a consricpted one. As part of conscription, servicemen will then be given a small allowance for their own daily personal use. We must also be cognisant that majority of servicemen are provided with lodging (Bunks), clothing (no.4, admin, etc) and food (Cookhouse) which arguably is what a servicemen need from Sunday to Friday.

I personally am not ignorant of the fact that 2 years is indeed a big sacrifice for any male citizen.  But if we do not do it, who should?

It's extremely two-faced.

If AWARE believes women shouldn't serve, they should say so and admit that there are biological differences in suitability for certain jobs, including the military. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, this is a viewpoint I personally hold.

If they think women should serve, then go actually advocate for it. Don't just sit there and yak about equality, ignore the elephant in the room, all while picking on ridiculous things like [discounts for frying pans on International women's da](https://mothership.sg/2017/03/heres-why-we-arent-upset-by-tangss-international-womens-day-frying-pans-promotion/)y and [advertisements targeted at potential molester](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-defend-anti-molestation-posters-after-aware-criticism)s. Again, there is nothing wrong with this position --- I think it is misguided, but at least their words would be consistent with their deeds.

But no. In AWARE's world, men and women ought to have equal representation at high-paying, important jobs. If not, it's a sign of the patriarchy in effect. But this enthusiasm is strangely missing when it comes to lowest lifeforms in the military.

Furthermore, many corporates AND Singaporeans of the opposite sex treat males as such. For example, most corporates offer the same pay structure for males and females and while that is fair at most other places, it is less so in Singapore due to the fact that every single male will always lose out to females in terms of career experience due to them having a 2 year head start along with the fact that works gets constantly disrupted due to reservist. As for females, why else do many females aspire to date expats? Obviously, I don't speak for all of them but a vast majority of them aim to do so. That is also why many guys kinda gave up and either remain single or look for a foreigner wife which is why there is a [rise in foreign brides in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/foreign-brides-are-getting-older-and-more-educated-msf-data-released-for-the-first-time). Heck just by wearing the uniform in public, one can't even sit in peace on one of the seats on the MRT without some aunty throwing dirty looks at that individual.

Keep in mind that all of these heart rending incidents are happening right here in our own country. Coupled with the fact that the government is constantly screwing over NS men, along with the several negligent deaths which they simply treat as a number, it is obvious that they dehumanize NS men while at the same time trying to ""motivate"" these people to protect the country where they don't feel much for especially with some who struggle with basic necessities like food.

Since one is already a 2nd class citizen and is already in such a predicament and struggling in one own's country, that individual might as well try their sleight at another country.

'When I was younger, I was very proud of being a Singaporean,' Mr Lim said. 'But that was about five, 10 years ago. Five years later, with all the changes in policies and the influx of foreign talent, I really don't know what I'm defending any more.'

He said he was reflecting a sentiment held by many of his men in the SAF, who had to compete with foreigners for jobs. 'I feel that there is a dilution of the Singapore spirit in youth... We don't really feel comfortable in our country any more.'

Mr Goh's reply was one of deep concern. 'This is one early sign of danger... If this is happening, it is very serious.'

He asked Mr Lim why he felt disconnected.

Mr Lim assured SM Goh that he was still keen to fight for Singapore: 'I'm still serving as an officer and I definitely would love to defend Singapore.'

However, he compared his attitude to that of the foreign friends he had. 'I tell them, this is my country. I can't just leave here whenever I want to. You can come and play and work here, but I have to stay here.'

SM Goh responded with a defence of the Government's open-door policy. 'You want to have a home. Who's going to build your HDB flat?'

'My brother got engaged, but lost his engagement because he could not afford an HDB flat,' Mr Lim countered.

'Without foreign workers in Singapore, would your hall of residence be built?' SM Goh asked. 'If we totally reject foreigners, we're going to shrink in size... I don't think Singaporeans want that. What they want is to moderate the inflow of foreigners.'

He also said Singapore had to find ways to integrate foreigners. 'There are many of them who would like to be Singaporeans, and those of them who can be integrated, make them Singaporeans, make them part of us, make them help to defend the country,' he said.

Mr Lim said that his concerns were somewhat different. 'My question was, how are we going to help the younger generation feel a sense of belonging to Singapore? I don't think it's about integrating foreigners.'

'This is your country,' SM Goh replied. 'What do you want me to do to make you feel you belong?'

'For my part, don't worry about me,' Mr Lim said. 'I will definitely do something, if I can, for Singapore. But I can tell you honestly that the sentiment on the ground is a bit different.'

'If that is prevalent among young people over here, we've got a real problem,' SM Goh said. 'If the majority feel they don't belong here, then we have a fundamental problem. Then I would ask myself: What am I doing here? Why should I be working for people who don't feel they belong over here?'

Based of our budget [Budget 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NCMYdWq4gf) this year, we are only 800M(>1% of overall budget) positive fiscally. 

Do you think it's fiscally viable to use this money to increase NSFs allowance? Factoring that we cumulatively been about 4.5B negative fiscally due to covid. TBH, I think there is room to debate on the amount as long as we include the national context.

Lastly, COL has been increasing due to rental/housing + transport. However these 2 are mitigated thru provision of lodging(mentioned in previous comment) and NSFs ez link pass. Taking reference from r/sgexams, the average expenditures of uni students surveyed ranges about 3-600 monthly. NSFs minimally given allowance of $680 as recruit/Pvt but more realistically would be given additional up to 200 more once they are going into vocations Trg.

SINGAPORE - Bubble tea chain iTEA will be taking down an advertisement that appeared to promote drinks like pearl milk tea as zero-sugar and zero-calorie.

The brand, which has 47 outlets islandwide, apologised for its mistake and said there was no intent to mislead consumers.

A brand spokesman said its claim was referring to its new sugar substitute, and not meant to create the impression that its drinks were zero-calorie.

But the advertisements, which had been up at 12 of the brand‚Äôs outlets since January 2024, had baffled consumers with its confusing and seemingly contradictory claims.

The promotion poster depicts three drinks ‚Äì jasmine green tea, pearl milk tea and matcha latte with azuki beans ‚Äì with text on the advertisement saying that there‚Äôs zero sugar, zero calories and zero guilt, which is applicable for all drinks.

Dr Max Seah, 35, who works in artificial intelligence, spotted the poster at the outlet in 205 Bedok North Street 1 on Jan 26 while he was waiting for his child‚Äôs vaccination to be done at the nearby polyclinic.

‚ÄúI thought it was bad marketing because it‚Äôs blatantly untrue that pearl milk tea and matcha latte can have zero calories,‚Äù said Dr Seah.

He added: ‚ÄúIf I buy a drink, I‚Äôll not base it on any of their claims. If I get a milk tea, I‚Äôll treat it like any milk tea I can get at any other shop. I‚Äôll just pretend their poster doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

Consumers were also perplexed by the Nutri-Grade ratings of the drinks on the poster.

Its pearl milk tea is rated C with 0 per cent sugar, and its matcha latte with azuki beans is rated C with 4 per cent sugar.

Mrs Sally Lee, 50, who works in the gas energy sector, did a double take when she had a closer look at the poster while she was waiting for her drink at iTEA‚Äôs Admiralty Place outlet.

‚ÄúIf the pearl milk tea has 0 per cent sugar, why is it rated C?‚Äù said Mrs Lee.

Drinks in the C range have between 5g and 10g of sugar per 100ml, or 1.2g to 2.8g of saturated fat per 100ml.

A drink‚Äôs Nutri-Grade rating is based on the highest sugar content offered by the brand. If the drink comes with toppings like pearls or jellies by default, the sugar content in the toppings are counted towards the drink‚Äôs Nutri-Grade rating.

SINGAPORE: Sometimes I find myself wishing I was raising my kids in an earlier era. No, this is not a sop to simpler times gone by - with more gendered social scripts and much greater poverty. But, I wonder if there are ideas from the past we can revive and combine with our modern nous, if we are to be a society that not only desires children, but has them too.

Fertility rates are dropping across most advanced economies, with Singapore‚Äôs resident total fertility rate (TFR) falling below 1 for the first time in 2023, to 0.97. A total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is needed to sustain a population.

In a poll conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), when we asked survey respondents what makes them not want to have kids, unsurprisingly, the expense and stress of having children were the top reasons.

This is despite the government deploying policy after policy over the last decade to make parenting more affordable. The new Budget introduces additional fee caps in government-supported preschools, with further reductions slated for 2026. The aim is to make preschool fees comparable to the combined fees of primary school and after-school care.

Nonetheless, parents understandably gripe that more should be done. We still do not have equal parental leave for mothers and fathers. And what we do have feels insufficient in terms of the crucial first 18 months of a child‚Äôs life and the context of dual careers. Free education and healthcare are also not features of our system.

Yet, despite significantly addressing all of the above and enjoying a reputation as a haven for pro-parenting policies, the Nordic region experienced a falling TFR over the last decade: Between 7 per cent in Denmark and 25 per cent in Finland. One possible response to this would be to question the point of these pro-family accommodations.

A more nuanced approach would acknowledge that sustaining increased birth rates is a mighty quandary. There is no way of knowing that fertility rates would not drop even more sharply without policy interventions. Yet, policies that alleviate the burdens of parenthood are not enough. We must develop both the financial accommodations and collective psyche for greater child-rearing.

That's true, but it's only a partial solution. While nearly everything else has dropped in price with respect to median salaries (food, education, healthcare, communication, transport, etc.), buying a home is quite unaffordable for a median single-income couple, because housing prices have risen sharply over the last few decades. Imo housing prices have to drop.

Agreed. Teaching people how to resist social pressure regarding productivity, and/or reforming society, is important if we want to raise birth rates.

Personally I find that my social status cannot be threatened. If someone tells me, ""what if your 3 kids lower your productivity at work?"", I'll laugh it off. But it also means that I'm unqualified to tell other people how to resist social pressure; ""just think of yourself as very high-status"" isn't a useful answer to most people.","Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice",266,0.95,3/1/2024,0

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for making all sorts of personal sacrifices: career, time, material comforts etc.

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for the sort of dysfunctional families that many grew up in and an unwillingness to project existing trauma and insecurities onto kids.

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for having kids as investment vehicles or retirement income sources. Some people don‚Äôt make enough for this not to be an issue.

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for what they consider regressive customs or groups like polygamy or religious cults of procreation.

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for the ever-accelerating rat race, and a desire not to subject kids to it.

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for having kids merely out of a fear of loneliness or having no one at your deathbed.

For some, it‚Äôs a vote of no confidence for our present inability to correct genetic defects and the potential birth of kids that inherit all sorts of incurable illnesses. This not an abhorrence of weakness. It is precisely kindness to these children to spare them from cruel competition against the healthy for which they will invariably suffer a great deal with practically no chance of coming out ahead. Forrest Gump is a movie, not reality.

The refusal to compromise is a simple one: the better educated in more developed places have principles. Many will choose not bring kids into the world without a good chance of a great life for everyone physically, mentally, materially. Perfectionists do not settle for less. Poor people who breed like livestock today are unprincipled, and so it is that much unnecessary trauma and suffering will continue for at least a few more generations.

Another thing old people can‚Äôt seem to comprehend is young people do not believe in suffering for suffering‚Äôs sake. It‚Äôs an entirely different mindset. Yes, there will always be a place for heroism in our culture but there is much more to life than to glorify sacrifices.

There is possibly a permanent solution in the long run to reversing the birth rate decline and it‚Äôs not throwing more money at the problem or reintroducing polygamy or converting everyone to a monotheistic faith.

1b3mech,ksxv2gf,3/2/2024 1:22,Kyokonizu,"Singapore is definitely feeling the crunch and at this pace, we are moving towards those of Japan and S. Korea which is bad.

In my opinion, like many others here, the main reasons why people do not want kids is because of the expected costs associated with kids. 

Being a parent, you always want to give the best you can for your kids. If not, you might feel that you have not provided enough (or at least give your kid the best chance) to win in life in the future. That‚Äôs a really scary thought isn‚Äôt it, if everyone else have this and that, but if you never provide for ‚Äòthis and that‚Äô then ultimately your kids lose out and the future may not be as bright. 

Costs in Singapore is rising so much, even hawker centre prices are going up (albeit slowly), housing is getting more expensive because of the fact there‚Äôs no control on developers pushing prices up (buy, rebuilt, resell: their biz model, that‚Äôs why your houses getting smaller. Divide more can sell more) so surrounding area housing prices also will shoot up. 

If housing is expensive, how are the citizens encouraged to get a place that is ‚Äúfit‚Äù to have children? Need at least 4RM which is costly. And there is no policy to help these families bridge into a bigger place (need to sell to down pay for the new house) so this is definitely a big consideration. Gov should step in and make this transition (either through grants, priority, gov int free loan are some suggestions) 

There‚Äôs also the expectation of time commitment to care for the kid. Working culture in Asia suck, there is little to no work life balance. We are all at the mercy of our employers. Because as a society, we are chasing GDP at the expense of our citizens.  We don‚Äôt even have much time to ourselves, how to have time for kids? OT culture is expected too, becomes the norm and then people turn into workaholics out of fear. 

This needs to change, some sacrifice of GDP may be necessary. This is top down from gov policy (just see what Australia did with the passing of law where employer cannot contact employees after a certain time). This stronghold maybe the necessary evil to provide a better work-life balance, with this, people may start to see life isn‚Äôt that bad and then want to have kids. Anyway, you can also increase GDP with a higher fertility rate, cause with more people, they spend more :) 

With a lot of foreigners coming into our little red dot also begets the question of why the need for those coming in as fresh grads? I understand we need foreign talents with experience but those at the start of their careers shouldn‚Äôt qualify as talent. This competition also makes people feel like their future kids have a lot of competition even for jobs. Like I have a couple of foreigner friends that started their careers in SG, did not serve NS. After a couple of years either become PR or Citizen. Mind you, they are way ahead in terms of careers than most of us that did NS. And‚Ä¶best, they don‚Äôt need to do reservice‚Ä¶so why do our kids have to suffer for these people? An idea is to make these newly minted PR, citizen compulsory to serve in volunteer core. If S.korea can delay and make citizen serve at 28-30, why not these people too? 


Another reason is the lack of convenience due to rising costs like vehicles. COE is so bloody expensive, and that‚Äôs actually a need for most couples with children. Going to the hospital, going to school etc need a car for sure. Encouraging people to have kids must also provide for the infrastructure behind this. What gov can do to encourage people to have kids is to allocate a portion of the COE to parents with kids (1-9 years old). These are the people who need it most, not the rich ones that have 6x - 9x cars sitting at home doing jack shit. 

Tax relief needs to improve for parents too, it‚Äôs already very expensive to bring up a kid. $3k/month doesn‚Äôt cut it for a child‚Äôs upbringing that may cost more than $1m. 

The people in power also need to walk the talk and lead by example. Since they have the economic ability to do so, they should market themselves to encourage more people to have kids‚Ä¶ cannot be encourage citizens to have kids then we suffer ma.. we need role models.

Well there are other options, equally unpalatable

1. Make sure no women have no good careers, like Afghanistan - then you can bet Birth rates will go up..
2. Equalize opportunity cost for those with/without children by forcing all men/women without children over age 30 without 2 kids to mandatory community service for 40 hours a week. Couples with 1 kid can get this quota halved.

Actually, even if by magic, from next year all child-related costs (from when baby come out until age 16 when baby has grown up and can make babies) ends up being heavily subsidized by government, it will have exactly zero impact on people in SG (from age 16-40) in whether they will want to have babies.

Work-related issues + $ issues preventing people from wanting babies is an **external** matter. **Internally**, people just either don't want babies at all or at most want just 1 baby (and maybe keep the 2nd baby if there is an accident). The mentality of entire generations having less internal desire to need/want to  get married/have babies/start family started when the working economy changed from a single-income household to dual-income household.

In a small country like SG, it is possible (I think) to institute advanced social engineering method(s) to psychologically manipulate people from a young age (basically when they start going to school), so that when they grow up, they have the desire to get married and start a family.

On the immediate front, eh..... besides the CDA, maybe have a GCDA (govt subsidize banks so that this account can have even higher interest) , so that when the child has grown up, can use the account for marriage/baby related costs..... can't ban condoms cos that will increase STD rate.... maybe change abortion law so that outside of the mother/baby having serious medical issue(s), its not as easy to abort in the case of unplanned pregnancy or baby born out of wedlock, and abortion having to require both the consent of the pregnant mother and the father.","Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice",266,0.95,3/2/2024,0

No, which is unfair, but how is that a rationale to force all girls to give birth to two kids? Your logic seems to be that if guys are forced to do something, the solution should be to force girls to do something *even worse* that will take away their basic freedom - and that of their male partners - to decide the life they want to live. It's not a solution. It just makes everything worse for everyone in this country, regardless of gender. Just make girls do NS too and solve everything.

> What if body weak , what if unfit ,what if bullied , what if 1 hand still serve?

Some of those are covered by the PES system. There can't be a similar filter for who will make a good parent, because that's incredibly subjective. Likewise more and more people simply can't afford to raise kids because of the rising cost of living. It also ignores how you will ensure that people successfully find a lifetime partner *in just two years* without forcing *both* the guy and girl to settle for someone they do not actually love or are attracted to - and you want them to raise children together, and you want to implement this country-wide.

> Many not suited for parents? But many still are

This also depends a lot on who their partner is. Raising a child with someone you love is very different from raising a child with someone you don't care for but had to settle for because of the 2 year deadline, which will likely be the majority of cases. That will mean a Singapore filled with young couples who do not love each other and may even resent each other, and that does not make for good parents, even if they would have been good parents with a partner they actually love.

It *also* ignores how it's not just women who raise the kids, unless you're expecting the men not to chip in. Do you really believe that every single guy in Singapore wants to spend the next 18+ years of his life raising kids the moment he finishes NS? And if not, doesn't that mean the burden will fall entirely on his wife, who would then unfairly have an additional 18+ years of work?

NS lasts two years plus reservist. It's most similar to a manual labour job. It is nowhere at all comparable to forcing a teenage girl to find a partner, marry the best option she can find within two years, and then pop out two kids before she and her partner are emotionally or financially ready for it.

I feel sorry for your wife and kids. (at least, I assume you're married with kids, since from your profile you're 24 years old, and you think it just takes 2 years to find a partner and marry them. You've had 4 years since your NS ended.)","Commentary: To raise fertility rates, Singapore needs to make parenthood seem less like the ultimate sacrifice",266,0.95,3/3/2024,0

Very much no - what if it was rape? Or a regular abusive relationship that cannot be proved, where the guy intentionally tricked her into getting pregnant because he wanted kids and she didn‚Äôt? Or if they just don‚Äôt know who the father is‚Ä¶

Meanwhile the issue isn‚Äôt lack of desire. I have many friends who want kids but can‚Äôt afford them (especially the sandwich generation who also have to look after our aging parents), or who are unable to find a partner, or too gay.

TDLR from the media articles - gov took back sports hub, minister and team set KPI for it to be pro-active in getting deals instead of the passiveness of previous management, ministry including minister goes down to US with KASM etc to music/sports events, met swift's team, found out they still working out their tour dates so SG strike the iron while its hot with the ministry setting the direction and goals.

I've encountered people like this in Singapore and other countries who threaten aggression and/or violence towards me. I think the important part is taking emotion out of it and recognising my personal choice to de-escalate. 

We *could* have escalated but made the explicit choice not to, which is completely fine. Things to consider like what if the uncle got physically violent towards you, what if he had a weapon, could you defend yourself against him alone, if not, what if nobody stands up to help you?

Walking away removes all these what-ifs and prioritises your safety, so it's a great decision imo. 99% of people I know who have trained in any real martial art will choose to walk away for these reasons. So despite choosing not to engage, you shouldn't think of yourself as a victim, rather a smart person who actively made the choice to de-escalate.

I also feel shaken up after these experiences but I hope you can find solace in knowing that you made an intelligent decision despite being under pressure in a dangerous situation

Edit: I just read the last part of your post. I'm really sorry that happened to you. If it helps, some of my female friends who have had similar experiences have shared that learning a self-defence martial art has helped them deal with their trauma to some degree. Despite what some people say, I have seen a lot of proof that learning even just a little bit of martial arts like MT/BJJ (for women of any age etc) can help greatly in defending against aggressive men.",A creep nudged his shoulder against mine on the train and I didn‚Äôt fight back,518,0.88,3/1/2024,0

He made many sexual comments and even insisted all I needed to be cured was to have intercorse with him...etcetc... I didn't have anyone to talk to for this interaction and it definitely worsened my already crippling social anxiety at that time for years.

you're probably like me, the non-aggressive kind. try asserting yourself in normal circumstances in diplomatic ways. Build that habit of gently asserting yourself. 

so that next time when you meet out and out horrible situations like this, the VERY MOMENT he stared at you, you move away. no replying to him or whatever.

that's how you can assert yourself. no need to be mad at yourself, not everyone is born to fight. 

ngl, I still feel PTSD from creeps too. the moment some old guy stares at me, I immediately move to a different carriage. I don't care if it was innocent staring, I don't exist to be someone's eye candy. the moment some guy (usually another dirty old man) walks towards me, staring and kind of wants to walk closer, I immediately stop and stare back at him.

I remember more than ten years back I was on a very crowded bus and standing behind an FT. Then he pressed his elbow against my chest. At first I thought it was accidental because the bus was too crowded but he kept doing it, at the pretext of taking something from his pocket but actually he wasn't taking anything. At the time I could only freeze because I didn't know what to do while I kept hoping that the guy would move away or there would be enough space for me to move away. I never even thought of voicing out because the bus was so crowded, and I was also overweight and i was afraid nobody would believe me.

But then it also taught me to voice out when I felt violated. So many years later, while seated on a bus, there was a man who kept poking his elbow into my side so I told him that he was taking up too much space. He immediately moved away. It seems this kind of people will stop when you show some kind of resistance because they only bother people whom they think are weak/helpless.",A creep nudged his shoulder against mine on the train and I didn‚Äôt fight back,518,0.88,3/1/2024,0

I have sympathy for our elders who are trapped in this adapt or die situation with tech and IT skills, but only to a point. Beyond that, it becomes a 'i won't help people who are unwilling to help themselves' type of thing.


I have one case study: my mom and her elder sister. My mom is in her early 60s, her elder sister (my aunt) in her late 60s.


Mom absolutely refuses to learn any basic IT skills, and keeps using this frustrating backwards logic of ""I'm alrdy so old, it's normal that I don't know. That's why I ask you for help ma.. if I know, I no need to ask you le"".¬†




It's as though she's proud of herself for being able to make it this far in this modern world without any modern IT skills, and chastises my father who is very willing to tinker with tech and IT, but sometimes messes up his phone/laptop/printer as as result.


If she was more open minded about adopting tech and digitisation, she would have saved thousands of man hours at her business, and could have probably saved it from collapsing, but that's another story.


My aunt, on the other hand, is almost 70 years old, but has learnt how to connect to wifi on her devices (ipad, smartphone, cctv), knows what's 2FA, can turn on a computer, can navigate web pages and do simple troubleshooting on her own.¬†

Both having only graduated primary school, and while my mother learnt enough English to be literate, my father is still below the literacy level. 

They are over the age of 60, and were born and raised in an old village before moving into a flat. They are not high achievers, with my mother and father both working factory jobs, and when they had me, my mother became a housewife and my father worked as a Shell grunt, before changing to work as a security guard in recent years.

I am telling you the gist of my parents, not to spin a tale, but to tell you that these old fashioned folks of mine have learnt and are still learning to adapt to the modern world. The older generation *CAN* adapt to newer things. With the older generation, yes they will be slow to pick up new things. But if they have the willingness to learn, they WILL learn it. And they WILL utilise it well.

My parents are extremely slow in learning these things, and yet now I am extremely proud of them. 

My mother is adapt at typing, has owned laptops, and even the first generation iPhone she bought out of curiosity. She is adept at finding new things, and making it work until she genuinely doesn't know how. Pinterest, Imgur, Dropbox etc.

My father understands that he's illiterate in English, so what does he do? He tries to change the language of everything he can to Malay. If he can't, he'll ask me.

I have worked at a university that caters to adult learning with part-time courses. It is genuinely hellish. Students need to juggle work commitments with course assignments and it is genuinely a superhuman task to juggle your job, your studies and your sustenance activities (eating/sleeping) within your limited 24 hours.


Your living standard plummets DRAMATICALLY if you attempt to learn new skills, especially outside of your physical prime (late 10s ~ early 30s).¬† It is not wrong to acknowledge limitations. Don't be daft. It is the government and the entitled rich who can live on their savings while they pick up new skills that find upskilling manageable. They are generalising their experience onto the multitude of average Singaporeans who will find it extremely difficult to juggle upskilling and job commitments.


Singapore is alienating its elderly by forcing the switch to digitisation while not having adequate preservation of legacy systems to cater to our elderly. They've worked their asses off most of their lives. The switch would have been fine if we had a stronger safety net and pension to have the elderly exit the workforce when their skills are outdated. But no, our government gives no protection to our elderly workers and expects them to upskill *to survive*.

And I also agree on the government alienating the elderly by the constant push towards a digital city, even if it would bring almost no benefit whatsoever. Case in point, the whole SimplyGoAway fiasco, the constant queues at Community Centres for CDC vouches that are readily available as an SMS hyperlink, the absolute fiasco that was the pandemic and the Tracetogether app However, this isn't about that. I don't think anyone, including OP, expects the older generation to know and use excel or something.

It's just the bare minimum for IT. Know the bare minimum for IT. You genuinely do not need to go for a part time course to understand the bare minimum, and I speak from experience from teaching my tech illiterate, English illiterate parent how to operate his devices. You just have to be a good support structure for them to be open with their insecurities with. 

I hope OP's Mom's workplace is sensible enough to train their workers on the new IT platform and not just drop and go, but it's Singapore so good luck is all I can say. But there is a genuine benefit at very little cost to learning modern IT stuff. For example, my mom has issues with her feet causing her unable to walk.

JAKARTA ‚Äì Thousands of Taylor Swift fans from South-east Asia will be converging on Singapore by plane, bus and even boat, as the singer‚Äôs Eras Tour approaches this weekend, beginning on March 2.

With a total of more than 300,000 tickets sold for six concerts at the National Stadium, overseas fans have already snapped up plane tickets and hotel accommodation in Singapore.

But others are taking more unconventional routes.

To save on transport and accommodation, some Swifties ‚Äì as the American singer-songwriter‚Äôs fans are called ‚Äì will be staying in nearby Batam and Johor Bahru before making their way to Singapore on the day of the concert.

Malaysian yoga studio manager Awangku Hashrul, 35, will first take the bus from his home in Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru with a friend the day before the concert on March 3. They plan to spend one night there.

The next morning, they will take the Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) train service from Johor to Singapore for the concert, before returning to Johor by train after the show ends. They will stay in Johor Bahru for one more night before returning home to Malaysia‚Äôs capital.

‚ÄúI am trying to save on the costs. Doing it that way is much cheaper. We already spent much on the tickets,‚Äù Mr Hashrul told The Straits Times, adding that he bought a concert ticket for about RM2,000 (S$565).

‚ÄúI am so excited. I think this might be the only chance that I might get to see her performing live. So, it is definitely the tour for me to go to. And I am glad I am going,‚Äù he said.

Mr Hashrul said that this way, he gets to spend a total of RM84 on transport, compared with the more than RM540 a round-trip flight ticket from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore would have cost him.

Meanwhile, staying in a hotel in JB for two nights costs him RM357. In Singapore, a two-night hotel stay would set him back more than RM1,000.

He is not the only fan going the extra mile.

Indonesian Tri Surinta, 26, will be travelling by minibus, plane and boat to catch Swift in concert.

2.	Grants offered by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB).
3.	STB provided Taylor‚Äôs team with the option of adding more shows if necessary.
4.	Stable governance, safety, and security in Singapore compared to neighboring countries.
- Taylor Swift‚Äôs 2014 concert in Thailand was canceled due to a military coup.
- A music festival in Kuala Lumpur was canceled following criticism by a singer regarding Malaysia‚Äôs anti-LGBTQ laws.
- Islamic leaders in Malaysia urged the cancellation of an Ed Sheeran concert due to the singer‚Äôs pro-LGBT stance.

- Clear economic benefits generated by foreign visitors, including contributions to Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport, hotels, transportation services, retail, food and beverage sectors, as well as the entertainment and casino industries.
- Further establishment of Singapore‚Äôs brand as a global and regional hub for music and entertainment.

As a Singaporean, I applaud STB for having the foresight and eagerness to secure this deal even before the Tour is announced.

SINGAPORE ‚Äì The Court of Appeal has upheld the death sentence imposed on a 33-year-old Singaporean man who was found guilty of heroin trafficking in 2022.

A total of 25 packets of drugs were found in a drawer in Shen Hanjie‚Äôs bedroom on Nov 20, 2018, containing 34.94g of pure heroin.

The apex court rejected his claim that he believed the drug bundles contained cannabis because ‚ÄúAlan‚Äù, his supplier, had said it was ‚Äúshao de‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúhot‚Äù in Chinese.

He said he understood this term to be the same as ‚Äúgu‚Äù, ‚Äúgrass‚Äù or ‚Äúganja‚Äù, which are terms for cannabis.

Shen, who was represented by Mr Mervyn Cheong had raised this argument in an attempt to rebut the legal presumption that he knew the nature of the drugs in his possession.

In a judgment on March 1, the three-judge court agreed with the trial judge that it was improbable that Alan had lied about the type of drugs involved, as Shen was keeping records of the transactions in his notebooks so that he could account to Alan on the movement of the drugs.

Shen had written down different entries for ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúgu‚Äù in the notebooks, which showed he did not think the two terms referred to the same thing, said the court.

The court added that even if Alan had lied about the nature of the drugs, Shen did not say he would have refused to help Alan, if the drugs were heroin instead.

‚ÄúHe was indifferent as to the nature of the drugs being sent to him by Alan, and appeared to be interested in their names only for the purpose of recording all the transactions so that he could give a proper account to Alan when asked,‚Äù said the court.

The Court of Appeal also rejected Shen‚Äôs argument that he was merely safekeeping the drugs for Alan, and not holding them for the purpose of trafficking.

During his trial, Shen claimed that Alan asked him to keep the drugs for him first, and that within a month, Alan would ‚Äúask his man‚Äù to take the drugs from him.

This did not support Shen‚Äôs defence as it would involve him delivering the drugs to someone other than Alan, said the court.

The court also noted that this was not Shen‚Äôs first transaction with Alan. For the previous transactions, Shen admitted that he would deliver the drugs to other people as directed by Alan.

The court found that Shen failed to give an adequate explanation why this transaction was going to be different.

Shen, who was unemployed at the time of his arrest, consumed crystal methamphetamine, or Ice, daily and had a gambling habit.

He stopped helping out at his father‚Äôs coffee shop two years prior to his arrest and received allowances from his parents when he needed money.

His financial woes even led him to pawn various items, including some of his parents‚Äô belongings.

Under the law, the death penalty can be imposed for trafficking in more than 15g of heroin.

1b3pyq2,ksudp8g,3/1/2024 12:42,Due_Sun7228,"Singaporean phd econ student in an ivy league university here. My current research focuses on empirical work, but during my master's and undergraduate studies, I delved into mechanism design, which is also Shengwu's area of expertise. Here, I'll attempt to explain his job market paper, a crucial piece of work for those aiming to secure an assistant professorship in economics.

Mechanism design investigates how to allocate resources or items between individuals effectively. While it might seem straightforward to rely on free markets for this, in practice, markets often fail to achieve optimal outcomes in terms of seller revenue, social efficiency, or equitable distribution. For example, setting a price for a unique item, like a limited-edition Swatch watch, is challenging without a clear market benchmark. Such items are frequently sold through auctions, a form of mechanism that transfers goods from sellers to buyers. However, mechanisms are not limited to auctions; they also include other forms, like lotteries used in BTO housing allocations. The goal of mechanism design is to create systems that achieve specific objectives, such as maximizing social welfare or seller revenue. This field is complex, as even minor modifications to mechanisms can significantly impact outcomes. For instance, altering auction formats to have winners pay the highest or second-highest bid can make a substantial difference.

For many decades, the prevailing belief in mechanism design was that ""second-price ascending auctions"" and ""second-sealed bid auctions"" were strategically identical (note that in a second price auction, the winner of the auction pays the second-highest bid for the object). Ascending auctions are ""public"", with bids revealed progressively until a winner is declared (e.g., auction where the auctioneer tries to shout ""going once, going twice... sold!""), whereas in sealed-bid auctions, participants submit private bids without knowledge of others' bids (e.g., construction tenders where each contractor has no idea how much his/her rival contractors are bidding for the project). Both formats were considered ""strategy-proof,"" meaning the best strategy for bidders is to bid their true valuation of the item, regardless of others' actions.

However, Shengwu notes that this equivalence is troubling because ""labatory subjects are substantially more likely to play the dominant strategy"" (i.e., bidding your own valuation for the object) under an ascending auction than a sealed-bid auction. So from a behavioural point of view, the evidence doesn't match the theory. He reconciles the two by introducing the concept of ""obviously strategy-proof"" mechanisms, where the benefit of adhering to one's current strategy is at least as good as the worst outcome of deviating. This makes ascending auctions more appealing to bidders with limited cognitive resources, as opposed to sealed-bid auctions, where deviating from the optimal bid can have significant consequences. Intuitively, the sealed-bid auction is  not ""obviously strategy proof"" as the the consequences are locked-in the moment you submit your bid. This stands in contrast to the ascending auction where you are able to ""wait and see"" before quitting.

The entire paper (https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44871788.pdf) is extremely mathematical and I won't go into the details for obvious reasons. However, I would note that Shengwu's formalization of OSP mechanisms has overturned what we have taught to masters and phd (econ) students for generations.",S'porean economist Li Shengwu gets tenure at Harvard University,528,0.94,3/1/2024,0

1b3pyq2,ksygt1q,3/2/2024 4:00,2juetoq,"> For many decades, the prevailing belief in mechanism design was that ""second-price ascending auctions"" and ""second-sealed bid auctions"" were strategically identical (note that in a second price auction, the winner of the auction pays the second-highest bid for the object).

How did anyone come to conclude that they're strategically identical when there is such a huge disparity in information available to the bidders? As you've explained, in ascending auctions the bids are publicly accessible to all bidders whereas in sealed bid auctions, the bidders only know their own bids. This is bound to change the bidders' behaviour.

It would have been understandable if the prevailing belief was that they're strategically *different* and it was only recently that someone developed a formalised proof on why this is so. But to believe that they're identical? And in the face of contradicting empirical evidence and no formalised proof? And that it was ""taught to masters and phd (econ) students for generations""?

SINGAPORE: Some Singaporeans may choose to use their SkillsFuture credits on courses seemingly irrelevant to careers. But this can still serve other purposes like lifelong learning, plain interest or just general well-being, said HR experts.

‚ÄúUsing the credits on non-career related courses does not take away from the original aim of the scheme,‚Äù said Associate Professor Trevor Yu of the Nanyang Technological University‚Äôs Nanyang Business School, pointing out that it was to get people started on ""a lifelong journey of constant learning"".

When they turn 25, all Singaporeans are given S$500 (US$371) in SkillsFuture credits that they can use on any registered course.

In his Budget speech in February, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the programme would be expanded ‚Äì Singaporeans will receive S$4,000 more in credits when they turn 40, but this amount can only be used on selected courses that result in better employment outcomes.

According to the SkillsFuture portal, there are currently over 29,000 courses available for those seeking to use their basic-tier credits.

Among these courses are options which can appear more esoteric or even raise eyebrows, such as when netizens last month ridiculed a S$580 class on toilet cleaning.

But experts urged against taking a ""narrow"" view and dismissing courses as ""frivolous"".

‚ÄúAs it is becoming more common to have two or more different careers across adult working age, what may be non-career related in the present could be a very viable proposition in the future,"" said Assoc Prof Yu.

Whether the knowledge gained from a course is ""useful"" ultimately depends on the individual, said Assistant Professor Aaron Ng from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).

The lecturer in digital communications added that individuals should think more deeply about the trajectories of their careers and lives to make effective use of the SkillsFuture credits.

‚ÄúThe government can help by lowering the barriers to gaining knowledge, but I don't think the government should be micromanaging the individual's future.‚Äù

SINGAPORE ‚Äì The total revenue collected by Singapore Land Authority (SLA) from state properties significantly exceeds the total maintenance cost incurred, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law Rahayu Mahzam.

She was responding on March 1 to Progress Singapore Party (PSP) Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai, who had asked about SLA‚Äôs management of state properties, including colonial black and white bungalows.

Mr Leong had sought more information about state properties, including how many of them were vacant and for how long. He noted that the black and white bungalow at 26 Ridout Road was vacant and ‚Äúin very bad condition‚Äù for more than four years before it was rented out.

The rental of state-owned bungalows at 26 and 31 Ridout Road by Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was the subject of a six-hour debate in Parliament in July 2023.

Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong said then that SLA had acted properly in leasing out the properties at 26 and 31 Ridout Road, and that it invests a significant amount in upkeeping and maintaining such properties, owing to conservation requirements and restoration guidelines.

On March 1, Ms Rahayu said the occupancy rate for all usable state properties was 99 per cent in the 2022 financial year.

SLA‚Äôs approach was to make basic additions to ensure that the properties are in a reasonably good condition so that tenants are able to reside in them safely, she added during the debate on the budget of the Ministry of Law, under which SLA is a statutory board.

She said SLA will install modern amenities and facilities for selected properties, where the overall circumstances make it advantageous to do so.

On Mr Leong‚Äôs point that state properties should not be allowed to ‚Äúfall into disrepair and be vacant for years‚Äù, Ms Rahayu said it would not be the best use of public resources to always renovate properties to a high standard before a tenant is found.

‚ÄúThis is because the condition of the property will deteriorate if there is no take-up, such as in a poor market. Taxpayer money would have to be used again, to redo some works and carry out additional works, when a tenant is found,‚Äù she said.

Ms Rahayu added that SLA has carefully broadened the usage and deployment of its properties to meet the evolving needs of Singapore over time, and that a judicious balance continues to be needed between protecting heritage properties in Singapore and redeveloping them.

Mr Leong later pressed Ms Rahayu on the the total rental income and total maintenance cost attributable to the black and white bungalows.

‚ÄúThese are questions that Singaporeans like to know and if enough information is being given, then we can assess better whether we have a big underutilised asset here or not,‚Äù he said.

For example, SLA may want to release more properties for community or charitable uses because these benefit the broader community. Obviously these aren't commercial in nature, so the rental revenue that SLA can collect would be lower than if they just looked for the most profitable uses. It's hard to compare them to purely profit-driven REITs.

Another consideration is to improve Singapore's vibrancy. I think something like Dempsey or Gillman Barracks would not have been possible if they just wanted to maximise profits above all else. 

Also have you seen the SLA state properties? Many of them are like 50+ years old and have very onerous maintenance costs due to conservation requirements etc.

And it's not like they can just sell off non-performing or sub-optimal properties either. They're stuck with them indefinitely (if the properties are conserved) or until there are development plans for the area.",Revenue collected by SLA from state properties significantly exceeds maintenance cost: MinLaw,40,0.88,3/1/2024,0

There's still quite a difference between not trying to maximise profits and not being concerned with your P&L.

Just because SLA is not purely profit driven doesn't mean that they don't aim to extract good value from their properties. It's just that they have competing interests to consider.

&#x200B;

Taylor Swift's upcoming concerts in Singapore have sparked a captivating narrative that transcends the realm of music, weaving together threads of economics, diplomacy, and passionate fandom. While Singapore anticipates a significant financial windfall, neighboring countries in Southeast Asia express a mix of disappointment, frustration, and even hints of regional competition.  


  
At the heart of the controversy lies Singapore's alleged use of financial incentives to secure Swift's exclusive performance, effectively locking out other Southeast Asian nations. This strategy has drawn criticism for its potential to create an uneven playing field and hinder regional collaboration in attracting tourism. Government officials and citizens from Thailand, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of such tactics, questioning if they prioritize short-term economic gain over fostering a spirit of regional cooperation.  


  
While the immediate economic benefits for Singapore are undeniable, with experts predicting a potential $300 million boost from tourism revenue, concerns linger regarding the long-term sustainability of this approach. Economists caution against relying solely on attracting high-profile celebrities as a growth strategy. They advocate for the development of unique attractions, cultural exchange programs, and sustainable tourism practices that foster long-term economic growth and regional collaboration.  


  
Despite the controversy, the allure of seeing Taylor Swift perform is undeniable, as evidenced by fans like 22-year-old Indonesian citizen Audilla Ferialdi. Ferialdi, along with countless others traveling from abroad, is injecting significant sums into Singapore's economy, even though their home countries were not included on the tour schedule. Her story exemplifies the power of celebrity culture to transcend geographical boundaries and generate economic activity, even if it raises questions about equitable distribution of benefits.  


  
This situation lays bare the complex interplay between various forces. The immediate economic benefits for Singapore are substantial, but the long-term implications and ethical considerations surrounding exclusive deals and the over-reliance on celebrity tourism warrant further discussion and potential reevaluation. As the music fades, a crucial conversation about regional collaboration, sustainable economic development, and fostering a spirit of inclusivity in the pursuit of shared prosperity in Southeast Asia takes center stage.",Taylor Swift's Asia Tour Stirs Some Bad Blood,0,0.29,3/1/2024,0

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Media freelancer Melissa Lee‚Äôs biggest wish is to watch American superstar Taylor Swift perform as many times as possible.

So far, she has spent more than $7,000 to attend three concerts of Swift‚Äôs The Eras Tour in Sydney, Paris and Singapore ‚Äì and has no regrets doing so.

Of the sum, $3,000 was for travel costs, concert merchandise and a VIP ticket in Sydney; $4,000 was for travel costs and a VIP ticket in Paris; and $350 was for her Singapore ticket.

The 26-year-old said: ‚ÄúMoney can be earned back, but not memories of this concert if I don‚Äôt go.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when Taylor Swift will go on tour again, and I was lucky to snag the tickets so I have to go.‚Äù

Thousands of Taylor Swift fans, known as Swifties, from South-east Asia will be arriving in Singapore by plane, bus and boat, as the 34-year-old singer-songwriter takes the stage on March 2.

But a number of devoted Singapore Swifties are also following the pop star for her concerts across Australia, Asia and the United States.

Ms Lee, who has been a fan since 2017, said the singer‚Äôs surprise song segment is an incentive for her to watch more concerts. During the fan-favourite segment, Swift plays two tracks that have not been played during previous shows.

However, in February, at one of her concerts in Melbourne, the singer announced she would abolish the no-repeat rule for surprise acoustic songs.

To all other Asian Countries: Let us remind you that this is a BUSINESS TRANSACTION and not a POLITICAL/CASH-GRABBING/WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. Business is about MONEY and the ABILITY to provide a SERVICE. And in this case, Singapore had this ABILITY to provide this service, and TS + Her Team liked it.

SINGAPORE: How much did Singapore pay to be the only regional stop for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour?

It is ""nowhere as high"" as reports have suggested, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong told CNA in an interview on Friday (Mar 1).

Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was quoted as saying last month that Singapore had brokered a deal to pay the pop star up to US$3 million for each of her six concerts ‚Äì in exchange for keeping the shows exclusive to Singapore in Southeast Asia.

CNA understands the figure is closer to US$2 million to US$3 million in total for all six shows.

Mr Srettha said he had heard about the arrangement from concert promoter AEG. The company has not responded to CNA's repeated requests for comment.

On Feb 20, the Singapore Tourism Board said it ""supported the event through a grant"", but did not reveal the size of the grant or any conditions attached to it.

Mr Tong said on Friday that concert promoters know ""exactly what they're doing"" when they choose where to hold shows and where not to.

""What I'll say is this: The numbers that you see online ‚Äì it is nowhere as high as what is being speculated.""

He added that he will speak more about this in parliament next Monday.

""NOT JUST ABOUT A GRANT""

""With every promoter, they make their own calculations,"" Mr Tong said. ""They decide whether they want to come, how many nights they want to come, where else they want to go.

""The truth of the matter is (it's) not just about a grant or a deal, but the overall package.""

He added that the promoters are experienced and know exactly what they want out of a venue, and there are factors that Singapore cannot control.

""They have to assess whether or not the overall package in Singapore is good enough for them to want to play here, and for how many nights,"" the minister said.

Swift will be playing six sold-out shows in Singapore, her only stop in Asia, aside from Japan. More than 300,000 tickets have been sold, with many fans travelling from other countries to watch the concerts.

SINGAPORE: A Singapore inter-agency task force led by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is looking into legislation to address security and resilience risks faced by key digital infrastructure such as data centres and cloud services.

Speaking in parliament on Friday (Mar 1), Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo said a potential Digital Infrastructure Act (DIA) will focus on areas that can cause a ‚Äúsignificant impact‚Äù on the economy and society if disrupted.

These include data centres and cloud providers that support the delivery of many widely used services such as banking and payments, ride-hailing, digital identities and social media, said MCI.

The law could require operators to meet higher security and resilience standards to reduce the likelihood of systemic disruptions, said Mrs Teo in a speech where she Iaid out her ministry's spending plans for the year.

Risks that such service providers face could range from misconfigurations in technical architecture to physical hazards such as fires, water leaks and cooling system failures.

Mrs Teo added that the inter-agency task force will continue to consult industry players and relevant stakeholders as it develops its proposals for the DIA.

1b3w78v,ksuwx4k,3/1/2024 14:56,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Secondary school students to have one common national exam period from 2027  

SINGAPORE - This year‚Äôs Secondary 1 students will be the first to sit their national examinations under one common timetable in 2027.

They will sit the new Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations in 2027 instead of O- and N-level examinations, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on March 1 in Parliament.

This comes after the removal of streaming into Normal and Express in secondary schools in 2024, and the implementation of full subject-based banding, where students take subjects at varying levels according to their strengths and interests.

With the change, students will have one written exam sitting for their mother tongue language (MTL) subject and will not be able to retake the exam, said Mr Chan during the debate on his ministry‚Äôs budget.

Currently, students are able to choose from two exam sittings for MTL, one in the middle of the year, usually in the first week of the June holidays, and the other during the O-level written exam period, usually in November.

‚ÄúI understand that some may be concerned that they will have one less chance to improve their MTL grades,‚Äù said Mr Chan.

‚ÄúBut we need to strike a careful balance between striving for excellence, chasing the last mark, and allowing our students to learn at a better pace.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we introduced the mid-year O-level MTL exam sitting in 1980, less than 40 per cent of students passed both their first and second languages,‚Äù Mr Chan noted. ‚ÄúSo we allowed students to take their MTL exam twice, to meet the second language requirement for pre-university.‚Äù

Today, almost all O-level MTL students meet the language requirement with their first sitting, he said, adding that taking the second sitting changed the post-secondary posting outcomes for less than 2 per cent of those taking the MTL exam.

‚ÄúThe new system will allow our students and teachers to better pace the MTL curriculum, with four more months of learning, rather than to squeeze everything into less than 3¬Ω years in preparation for the June sitting,‚Äù said Mr Chan.

Students will sit their English and MTL written exams in the second week of September ‚Äì one month ahead of other subjects to spread out the exam load, he added.

There will also be one common exam period for the written papers of other subjects, starting in October.

Currently, N-level exams are held in September, and O-level exams in October.

Results for the SEC examinations will be released in January the following year.

1b45mta,kswquzn,3/1/2024 21:10,SG_wormsbot,"Title: Forum: Naming the pre-schools allegedly involved in child abuse cases could lead to more accountability  

With cases of alleged abuse happening in pre-schools recently reported in the media (Boy, 3, allegedly locked in dark room and shouted at by pre-school teachers; police investigating, Feb 28; and Woman charged with ill-treatment of child at pre-school; she allegedly hit 1-year-old multiple times, Dec 8, 2023), we parents cannot help but wonder if our children are truly safe in pre-schools, as well as what can be done to make the places safer.

In the recent cases, the pre-schools involved were not named on the basis that this could lead to the identification of the alleged victims, which is prohibited under the Children and Young Persons Act.

I think the pre-schools involved should not be allowed to hide their identity under the veil of this Act. Knowing that their reputation would be damaged if they were to be named publicly would make them take more accountability for their actions.

The public would also later be able to judge for themselves if the pre-schools involved have done enough to improve the situation.

And it would serve as a deterrence to other pre-schools and help ensure that their staff conduct themselves appropriately.

SINGAPORE: As part of moves to attract and nurture top minds in the area of artificial intelligence (AI), Singapore will launch professorships as well as a masters programme, said Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo on Friday (Mar 1).

The AI Visiting Professorship aims to attract top researchers to collaborate with Singapore, and the plan is to award it to a pilot batch of five visiting professors over the next few years, said the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).

These professors will be required to spend at least 20 per cent of their time on these collaborations. They will also need to identify a local collaborator and will be encouraged to supervise junior researchers and students in Singapore.

‚ÄúThe goal is for these AI visiting professors to drive research aligned with our national AI research agenda, provide increased training opportunities for local students and catalyse additional research activities in Singapore,‚Äù said MCI.

This follows Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong‚Äôs announcement during his Budget 2024 speech earlier in February, that the government will invest more than S$1 billion (US$743.7 million) over the next five years in AI computing, talent and industry development.

This supports Singapore‚Äôs updated National AI Strategy (NAIS) 2.0, which was launched in December last year.

‚ÄúThere is no doubt that technology has become a big part of Singaporeans' daily lives,‚Äù said Mrs Teo in parliament, laying out her ministry's spending plans for the year.

""Overall, 84 per cent say that digital technologies have made their lives easier, and more than half are prepared to try new technologies.""

I am being reminded of the past issues I had with my family members, and returning back to sg just triggered the negative emotions and behaviours that is subconsciously hidden inside me. When I saw them for the first time again in a span of four, five years, I felt so nervous inside me and after I left them physically to take my own quiet rest, I went to the toilet and vomited. During my one week in singapore, I was at the funeral with my family members (besides with my husband) and felt so overwhelmed with everything happening and binged a lot on food which I hardly did it, and gained some weight after I went back to Japan with my husband. Then, until now, I didn't have much time to myself, worked, housechores etc and even if I rest I couldn't feel like the same before the return trip. I feel like something in me triggered the overeating, purging due to stress and getting irritated and angry over small issues. Just few days ago, I felt so sick mentally and physically that I had to take leave from my job and stay home to rest, but even so, I was just feeling so empty, and crying inside (but I can't cry), eating, vomitting and feeling numb again. I am visitng a gp doctor who prescribes me psychiatric medications but I feel I should visit another doctor again. Really hate my mental issues and eating disorder problems (after all these years, I still cannot overcome the mindset of gaining weight).. just want to rant.","/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for March 02, 2024",10,0.79,3/2/2024,0

Tbh it was really good, Norway (or Scandinavian countries in general) just has that happy, can cure depression kind of vibe. I think it's called Hygge. So can explore their cities on walks, go to museums, cafe hopping. In Tr√∏mso we also went dog sledding, also got whale watching, fjord tours to see the fjords. Pack heavily, winter is intense, the snow gets to knee length. We stayed in Airbnb and took budget airline flights to the 3 cities we went to, so actually I think I didn't spend up to 7k, it was more like 3/4k for me. We cooked most days, ate out for a couple of meals for each city. That's how we kept to budget. (And maybe also cos my flight tix was UK-Norway but hers is Singapore-UK-Norway) 

>Though they mentioned $7k budget, that was my expense for Japan last year so I think this one is probably even higher?

It could be, inflation this year now would suck :(

SINGAPORE ‚Äì Social enterprise Dignity Kitchen is hoping to raise $200,000 for restoration works after a fire damaged its premises on Feb 13. It has received over $23,000 from more than 200 people on crowdfunding platform Give Asia so far.

The organisation‚Äôs 10,600 sq ft premises at 69 Boon Keng Road were damaged after a fire in the rubbish collection centre next to its building spread, destroying its wall, roof, electrical items and air-conditioning units.

The incident, which occurred in the wee hours of the morning, has been classified as ‚Äúmischief by fire‚Äù and police investigations are ongoing.

Founder Koh Seng Choon, 65, told The Straits Times he was away in Hong Kong, where he has another Dignity Kitchen branch, when the incident happened. He returned to Singapore on Feb 28.

Dignity Kitchen is run by Project Dignity, a social enterprise founded in 2010 to create jobs for people with disabilities. Its Singapore branch comprises a full-functioning hawker centre open to the public, a culinary training centre, social outreach programmes, and secondhand book stalls.

Mr Koh told The Straits Times the training centre suffered the main damage. The quotation he received for repairing the exterior walls, as well as replacing the air-conditioning units and roof, amounted to about $130,000. However, the full extent of the damage cannot be assessed until the roof is removed. It will also take some time for his insurer to determine and process the payout.

Training makes up 30 to 40 per cent of Project Dignity‚Äôs total business revenue, he said. Dignity Learn, its inclusive training programme, provides Workforce Skills Qualification- and SkillsFuture-eligible hawker culinary courses for the public. It also runs a 22-day Train-and-Place programme for adults with special needs seeking employment.

Mr Koh said he has asked for urgent rewiring works and bought a portable air-conditioner to resume training classes, but lessons will have to stop again for about 12 weeks when restoration works are carried out. He added that he could not yet determine the total amount of revenue loss.

The food court, which has seven stalls manned by the differently abled and disadvantaged, resumed operations on Feb 19. Its operations include providing free box meals to 90 low-wage workers for dinner from Mondays to Fridays.

‚ÄúWe lost business at our food court for several days, including over Valentine‚Äôs Day and part of Chinese New Year,‚Äù Mr Koh said. ‚ÄúBusiness is picking up again now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have been through a lot of crises but we are still growing. One good thing that came out of this is that my team of over 100 staff handled the crisis well while I was away.‚Äù

Entrepreneur Vivian Pan, 39, donated $100 to Dignity Kitchen‚Äôs fund-raiser.

‚ÄúMr Koh is a humble man and good leader,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt give up and keeps fighting for his dream.‚Äù

Director fees ? (For a non-profit / social enterprise ??. I myself a director in a non-profit and there are tons of people who want to be on board).. Manpower costs are taking a significant chunk. While I don't expect people to work free (in fact they should get a bit more) a bit taken by the % . If we look in to the details, 

* Gross profit is pretty good (from 27% in FY2019 to 37% in FY20 to 41% in FY21)
* Other op expenses went (from 54% in FY2019 to 75% in FY20 to 69% in FY21) and these are essentially staff costs
   *  based on Google, 120x employees (70 in SG, 50 in HK) and the expenses were closed to a mil which is \~ 8K per employee and very reasonable
   * Foreigner levy etc increased 2020 vs 2021 means employed foreigners post covid (much needed in F&B)
   * Director fee of 100K (I may be wrong but is it to the Board / CEO pay?) if it's the CEO, that's pretty ok and nobody can work for free. For directors - then I do mind :)

Again, huge respects (as a father of special needs child) and I've visited dignity kitchen multiple times and I do visit time to time. 

Thanks for the clarification on insurance (takes time etc) and just donated to the initiative and will continue donating without a doubt. This person is doing 100x of what many keyboard warriors (myself one) couldn't do in their lifetime.

A Malaysian worker can live in Malaysia, go to Singapore for work and return home for dinner and be with your family. No need to live and rent in SG. You make SGD but spend in MYR. A dream scenario for many Malaysians.

HSR is a giant talent vacuum cleaner for Singapore that spread catchment a lot further into Peninsula Malaysia that further accelerates the brain drain.

The fiscal implications can be enormous. Singapore benefits from the talent, they pay social security and taxes in SG, but because Malaysians return home, the Malaysian state bears the costs of housing, security, medical, education. So Singapore collects most of the revenue and productive benefits while Malaysia foots most of the social costs, lose revenue and talent.

Malaysia probably hope for greater SG tourism and more property and business investment. There may be a bump but it may not sufficiently mitigate the huge loss of talent and revenue. Unless the rental market improves significantly, Malaysia property will still be unattractive to Singapore properties that command strong rentals.

HSR therefore may further increase demand for Singapore Dollars and strengthen SGD vs MYR in the long run.",The Big Read: Malaysia's brain drain to Singapore ‚Äî winners and losers in the long run not so clear-cut,247,0.95,3/5/2024,0

NOTHING TO SAY OR SOMETHING TO HIDE?

Ronan Keating once famously sang, ‚ÄúYou say it best when you say nothing at all.‚Äù While the song was about how the protagonist‚Äôs gestures communicate better than words, there is also a more cynical interpretation that people tend to assume that one has something to hide. And once that is seeded into a mob mentality, it tends to stick.

In the past, when a press statement cites ‚Äúunforeseen circumstances‚Äù, the public was largely dependent on the skill of the journalist to fully report what happened. If the public wasn‚Äôt satisfied by news reports, their questions were often only heard in their circles or coffee shops.

Today, the public‚Äôs questions are in full view, and these unanswered questions serve to create opinions about organisations.

Questions such as, why didn‚Äôt the event organiser for the sky lantern festival get all the necessary permits before marketing the event? How was getting necessary permits ahead of time ‚Äúunforeseen‚Äù?

Why didn‚Äôt the event organiser, after conducting their failed trials, not inform ticket holders immediately that the event might not go ahead as planned and offer the option for refunds?

All these questions, when not answered, will result in the public forming the opinion that the event organiser cannot be trusted, which will then impact their ability to market more events in the future.

The impact is not limited to just the event organiser. Sentosa, for example, stated that the event was organised by a third party, for which it was the venue provider.

But questions could be asked by the public as to how Sentosa selects events for their premises. Those questions are raised because Sentosa is no ordinary venue provider, it is a national icon and a shining beacon of Singapore‚Äôs attractiveness as a tourist destination.

To protect that reputation, could Sentosa have shared why they agreed to rent the venue out to the organiser and perhaps build a narrative of their due diligence process?
